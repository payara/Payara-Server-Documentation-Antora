= Payara Community 5.2020.5 Release Notes

== Supported APIs and Applications

* Jakarta EE 8
* MicroProfile 3.3
* Java EE 8 Applications

== Notes

=== Run Jakarta EE 9 Applications (in Tech Preview)

This release includes tech preview functionality to run Jakarta EE 9 applications on Payara Server and Payara Micro. This does not, however, make this edition of Payara Platform Community Jakarta EE 9 compatible, and we do not recommend using this functionality in production at this time. This should not affect the ability to run Jakarta EE 8 applications. See https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4813[FISH-256] for more details.

=== New Notifier Extensions

https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/4884[FISH-315] gives the notification service a major overhaul that makes implementing new notifiers in a modular fashion easier. This has facilitated the rewrite of the notifiers as extensions in a separate project https://github.com/payara/Notifiers[payara/Notifiers], and the implementation of new Discord (https://github.com/payara/Notifiers/pull/3[FISH-471]) and Microsoft Teams (https://github.com/payara/Notifiers/pull/11[FISH-370]) notifiers. Note that the notifiers that were previously removed from the Payara Platform Community Edition (now in the https://github.com/payara/Notifiers[payara/Notifiers] project) will remain available in Payara Enterprise Edition out of the box.
