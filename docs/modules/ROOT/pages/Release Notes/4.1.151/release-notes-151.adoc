= Release Highlights

JBatch has been upgraded to version `1.0.1-b04` and now recognizes MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Oracle, and DB2 as persistence managers. Hazelcast `3.4` has also been implemented
as a clustered web session store and provider of JSR107.

We are also now providing distributions of the Multi-Language (ml) releases,
which contain the l10n packages from GlassFish.

NOTE: We lack translations for the additions we have made, such as the Hazelcast
configuration page in the Admin Console. We would prefer to not accept internet
translations as they are typically inaccurate.
