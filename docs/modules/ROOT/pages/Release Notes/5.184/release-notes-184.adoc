== Release Highlights


[[important-information]]
=== *Important Information*

* JDK version 8u162 or newer is no longer required
* When upgrading Payara Server from an older version, make sure to use JVM options appropriate for your JDK version. See the Notes section below for more details
* Some IDE plugins have problems with the default JVM options in Payara Server 5.184. In Netbeans, you should update the xref:/documentation/ecosystem/netbeans-plugin/Overview.adoc[Payara plugin] to version 1.5. For Eclipse IDE there's a workaround. IntelliJ works out of the box. See the xref:#known-issues[Known issues] section in case you run into problems

[[supported-apis-and-applications]]
== Supported APIs and Applications

* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 2.0 (in v5.184) / 1.4 (in v4.1.2.184)

== Notes

=== Upgrading from older versions

When upgrading from a domain used by an older version of Payara Server you may run into issues due to changes in ALPN.

We recommend modifying domain.xml by removing `grizzly-npn-bootstrap.jar` JVM option and adding appropriate JVM option for your JDK version. Or you can just copy all the `grizzly-npn-bootstrap` JVM options from a https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/3414/files#diff-106a22dc9db673bf7b67c76cf69914aaR256[default domain.xml] in Payara Server 5.184.

If you apply the JVM options in the default domain.xml in version 5.184, you'll avoid problems if you update the JDK in the future. The default configuration takes advantage of JDK version selectors supported in JVM options and will instruct Payara Server to choose the appropriate `grizzly-npn-bootstrap` JAR.

Beware that future versions of JDK (beyond u192) may break the ALPN contract again and subsequent version of Payara Server will need to provide another version of `grizzly-npn-bootstrap` JAR to fix it.

TIP: Users with a support account can follow the https://support.payara.fish/hc/en-gb/articles/360012350494-Upgrade-to-Payara-Server-5-184[Guide to Upgrading to Payara Server 5.184].

=== PasswordLoginModule Changes

In Payara 5.182 login modules often extended from a base login module
called com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.login.PasswordLoginModule. This
base class however was redundant and only provided for backwards
compatibility as per the following comment on it:

_________________________________________________________________________________________
This class is provided for backward compatibility and is a candidate
for deprecation.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

In order to simplify the security system somewhat by reducing the amount
of redundant classes, this class has been removed since Payara 5.183.
Its direct preferred replacement for a long time has been
`com.sun.enterprise.security.BasePasswordLoginModule`. This class is now
the only (and therefore mandatory) replacement.

=== Principal String Representation Changes

String representations of principals that are based on X500Principals
have changed since Payara 5.184. The sequence of RDNs (Relative
Distinguished Names) used to be rendered with a comma (,) and a space
( ) as separator, but due to an internal class change are now rendered
with only a comma character (’,’ ASCII 44) as separator. For instance
a distinguished name that used to be represented in string form as
`"C=UK, ST=lak, L=zak, O=kaz, OU=bar, CN=lfoo"` is now represented as
`"C=UK,ST=lak,L=zak,O=kaz,OU=bar,CN=lfoo"`

[[known-issues]]
== Known issues

* Fresh Payara Server 5.184 doesn't start in Netbeans with a Payara plugin older than version 1.5 and with the current GlassFish plugin. This is because the Netbeans plugin modifies the standard start procedure but doesn't understand Java version selectors in JVM options, which leads to an error in the plugin. This is fixed in the  Payara NetBeans Plugin version 1.5 which is already available in our xref:/documentation/ecosystem/netbeans-plugin/Overview.adoc[Netbeans repositories]. For older versions or for a GlassFish plugin, you can fix this if you replace multiple JVM options for `grizzly-npn-bootstrap` in the https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/3414/files#diff-106a22dc9db673bf7b67c76cf69914aaR256[default domain.xml] with a single option that matches your Java version and remove the Java version selector. 
* Fresh Payara Server 5.184 doesn't start in Eclipse IDE with any current plugin. You should apply the same  workaround as for an older Netbeans plugin: replace multiple JVM options for `grizzly-npn-bootstrap` in the https://github.com/payara/Payara/pull/3414/files#diff-106a22dc9db673bf7b67c76cf69914aaR256[default domain.xml] with a single option that matches your Java version and remove the Java version selector
* There are no issues in IntelliJ as it starts Payara Server in a standard way
