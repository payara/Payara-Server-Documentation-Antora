= Payara Server 4.1.2.184 Release Notes

NOTE: This version is distributed only to Payara Enterprise customers

== Notes

=== Principal String Representation Changes

String representations of principals that are based on X500Principals
have changed since Payara 4.1.2.184. The sequence of RDNs (Relative
Distinguished Names) used to be rendered with a comma (,) and a space
( ) as separator, but due to an internal class change are now rendered
with only a comma character (’,’ ASCII 44) as separator. For instance
a distinguished name that used to be represented in string form as
`"C=UK, ST=lak, L=zak, O=kaz, OU=bar, CN=lfoo"` is now represented as
`"C=UK,ST=lak,L=zak,O=kaz,OU=bar,CN=lfoo"`
