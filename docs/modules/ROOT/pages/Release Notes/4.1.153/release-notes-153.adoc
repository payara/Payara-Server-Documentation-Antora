= Release Highlights

This release has several notable features:

* The Payara Micro API has been improved, now granting control over running instances and the
ability to run asadmin commands.
* There is now an auto-binding feature for the HTTP and HTTPS ports of Payara Micro instances.
This feature allows Payara Micro instances to automatically find a free port if the default
or specified HTTP or HTTPS ports are already bound to.
* This release also introduces the Payara-Blue series of distributions, built using
the IBM JDK for AIX systems.

See the http://payara.co.uk/whats-new-in-payara-server-41153[What's new in Payara 4.1.153]
blog for descriptions of these features.
