== Supported APIs and Applications

* Jakarta EE 8
* Java EE 8 Applications
* MicroProfile 4.0

== Notes

=== MicroProfile 4.0

Following the 5.2020.7 release, weâ€™ve upgraded Payara Platform to be compatible with the specifications present in version 4.0 of MicroProfile. You should be able to test your MicroProfile 4.0 compatible applications using this Community release. If you discover any issues, or have any related questions, please raise them on our GitHub repository. 

=== Asadmin Command to Clear old JBatch Executions

A new command has been introduced with FISH-108 to remove old JBatch executions left around in the database. It is a known issue that this command currently only works with H2 database. In a future iteration, this will be generalised to cover a broader range of databases. 

=== Hazelcast 4.0 Upgrade

It is important to note in this release that with the upgrade of Hazelcast to version 4.0, support for rolling updates from previous versions of Payara Community Edition to 5.2021.1 will not be supported.
