== Maven Coordinates

The public API is released as a Maven artifact in *Maven Central*. To
use it in a Maven project, set the following dependency in your
project's POM:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>fish.payara.api</groupId>
    <artifactId>payara-api</artifactId>
    <version>${payara.version}</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

Where `${payara.version}` of the artifact corresponds with the
oldest version of Payara Server your application should support.
