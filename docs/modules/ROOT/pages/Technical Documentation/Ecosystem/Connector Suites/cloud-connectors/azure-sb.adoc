= Azure Service Bus Cloud Connector

The Microsoft Azure Service Bus allows code that runs both outside and inside
Azure to communicate with Azure.

In order to connect to Azure, the `AzureSBRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` has to
be deployed as shown in the xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/Overview.adoc#Installing-a-connector[
Installing a connector section] of the Cloud Connectors overview.

In order to make use of this connector in an application, the following maven dependency is needed:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.cloud.connectors</groupId>
  <artifactId>AzureSBJCAAPI</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Note that this dependency have scope provided since the types within this
dependency are globally available to every application deployed to Payara Micro
after the `AzureSBRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` was deployed.

== Sending messages

Sending messages to Azure can be done via the JCA and an Azure specific API. In
order to start using this API to send messages, a resource has to be defined via
the JCA API; a connection factory.

The connection factory has to be given a name, which can be any name that is
valid for JNDI. The `java:app` namespace is typically recommended to be used.
The type of the connection factory to be used for the Azure Service Bus is 
`fish.payara.cloud.connectors.azuresb.api.AzureSBConnectionFactory`, and we have
to specify the resource adapter name which is here `AzureSBRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Finally the Azure credentials have to be specified. 

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@ConnectionFactoryDefinition ( 
  name = "java:app/azuresb/factory",
  interfaceName = "fish.payara.cloud.connectors.azuresb.api.AzureSBConnectionFactory",
  resourceAdapter = "AzureSBRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  properties = {"nameSpace=payara", "sasKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey", "sasKey=someKey"}
)
----

With the above shown definition in place the following code shows an example of sending a message:

[source,Java]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class SendAzureMessage {
 
  @Resource(lookup = "java:app/azuresb/factory")
  private AzureSBConnectionFactory factory;
 
  @PostConstruct
  public void init() {
    try (AzureSBConnection connection = factory.createConnection()) {
        connection.sendMessage("testq", new BrokeredMessage("Hello World"));
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
    }
  }
}
----

== Receiving messages
Messages can be received from Azure by creating an MDB (Message Driven Bean)
that implements the `fish.payara.cloud.connectors.azuresb.api.AzureSBListener`
marker interface and has a single method annotated with `@OnAzureSBMessage`
and the method signature `void method(BrokeredMessage message)`.

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "nameSpace", propertyValue = "payara"), 
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "sasKeyName", propertyValue = "RootManageSharedAccessKey"), 
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "sasKey", propertyValue = "someKey"), 
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "queueName", propertyValue = "testq") 
})
public class ReceiveAzureMessage implements AzureSBListener {
    @OnAzureSBMessage
    public void receiveMessage(BrokeredMessage message) {
        // Handle message
    }
}
----

The full list of config properties is given below:

[cols="2,1,1,7",options="header"]
|===
|Config Property Name
|Type
|Default
|Notes

|sasKeyName
|String
|none
|The SAS Key Name defined in your Service Bus namespace

|sasKey
|String
|none
|The SAS Key. Environment variable replacement can be used so that this is not
exposed in the code

|The Azure namespace of your Service Bus

|queueName
|String
|none

|initialPollDelay
|Integer
|1
|The Initial Poll Delay (in seconds) before the Adapter starts polling for
messages after deployment (MDB Property Only)

|pollInterval
|Integer
|1
|The Poll interval (in seconds). This is how often the MDB polls for new
messages (MDB Property Only)

|pollTimeout
|Integer
|1
|The Poll Timeout (in seconds). This is how long the MDB should wait for
messages in a single poll (MDB Property Only)
