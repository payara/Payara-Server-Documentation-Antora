= Apache Kafka Cloud Connector

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream processing platform. It is based on a
massively scalable publish/subscribe message queue architected as a distributed
transaction log.

In order to connect to Apache Kafka, the `KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` has to be
deployed as shown in the xref:documentation/ecosystem/cloud-connectors/Overview.adoc#Installing-a-connector[
Installing a connector section] of the Cloud Connectors overview.

Once deployed, something like the following should be printed to the startup
log of Payara Micro Community:

----
[fish.payara.cloud.connectors.kafka.inbound.KafkaResourceAdapter] [tid: _ThreadID=1 _ThreadName=main] [timeMillis: 1495395212347] [levelValue: 800] Kafka Resource Adapter Started..
----

In order to make use of this connector in an application, the following Maven
dependency is needed:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.cloud.connectors.kafka</groupId>
  <artifactId>KafkaRARAPI</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>jar</type>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

Note that this dependency has scope `provided` since the types within this
dependency are globally available to every application deployed to Payara Micro Community
after the `KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.rar` was deployed.

== Sending messages
Sending messages to Apache Kafka can be done via the JCA and a Kafka specific
API. In order to start using this API to send messages, a resource has to be
defined via the JCA API; a connection factory.

The connection factory has to be given a name, which can be any name that is
valid for JNDI. The java:app namespace is typically recommended to be used. The
type of the connection factory to be used for Kafka is
`fish.payara.cloud.connectors.kafka.KafkaConnectionFactory`, and we have to
specify the resource adapter name which is here `KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

The following gives an example:


[source,Java]
----
@ConnectionFactoryDefinition ( 
    name = "java:app/kafka/factory",
    interfaceName = "fish.payara.cloud.connectors.kafka.KafkaConnectionFactory",
    resourceAdapter = "KafkaRAR-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
)
----

With the above shown definition in place the following code shows an example of
sending a message:

[source,Java]
----
@Singleton
@Startup
public class SendKafkaMessage {
 
 @Resource(lookup = "java:app/kafka/factory")
 private KafkaConnectionFactory factory;
 
 @PostConstruct
 public void init() {
    try (KafkaConnection connection = factory.createConnection()) {
        connection.send(new ProducerRecord("test","hello","world"));
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
    }
 }
}
----

== Receiving messages
Messages can be received from Apache Kafka by creating an MDB (Message Driven
Bean) that implements the `fish.payara.cloud.connectors.kafka.api.KafkaListener`
marker interface and has one or more methods annotated with `@OnRecord` and the
method signature `void method(ConsumerRecord record)`, or `@OnRecords` and the
method signature `void method(ConsumerRecords records)`

The following gives an example:

[source,Java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "groupIdConfig", propertyValue = "testGroup"),
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "topics", propertyValue = "test,test2"), 
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "autoCommitInterval", propertyValue = "100"),  
 @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "pollInterval", propertyValue = "3000")
})
public class ReceiveKafkaMessage implements KafkaListener {
 
 @OnRecord(topics="test")
 public void receiveMessage(ConsumerRecord record) {
     // Handle record
 }
}
----
