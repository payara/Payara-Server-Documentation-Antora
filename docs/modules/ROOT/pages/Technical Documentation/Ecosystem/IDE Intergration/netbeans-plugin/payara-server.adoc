[[adding]]
== Adding Payara Server to NetBeans

1. Go to *Tools - Servers*.
2. Click *Add Server*.
3. Select *Payara Server* and choose a name for the server.
4. Select the location of the `payara` directory of your Payara Server (Payara 4
or Payara 5) installation. If the DAS is on another machine then check 
the *Remote Domain* box, otherwise select *Local Domain*. Read and accept the
license agreement.
5. Enter the following details for the domain:
  * Domain -> This is the name of the domain you want to use. By default this
  is `*domain1*`.
  * Host -> This is the hostname that the server will be listening on. By
  default this is `*localhost*`.
  * DAS Port -> This is the port that the `*admin-listener*` listens on. By
  default this is `*4848*`.
  * HTTP Port -> This is the port that the application will be hosted on. By
  default this is `*8080*`.
  * Target -> This is the name of the node that the application will be getting
  deployed to. This can be left blank if it is a local installation.
  * Username -> This is the admin username for Payara Server. By default this
  is `*admin*`.
  * Password -> This is the admin password for Payara Server. By default this
  is blank.

That's how to add Payara Server to NetBeans. You'll see a window where the final
configuration settings can be changed.

The previous options are all repeated here, with a few new options. You can
click the *help* button in the bottom right to see what they all do in detail.
Disabling the registered Derby server will speed up server start time.


[[managing]]
== Managing Payara Server from NetBeans

All of the management of Payara Server Community from NetBeans is done through the
*Services* tab which can be found next to the *Projects* and *Files* tabs.

Once Payara Server is added to NetBeans it can be found under *Servers* with
the configured name. Right clicking on the server let's you do the following
things:

* Start or stop the server.
* Start debugging the server.
* Open admin console.
* Open server log.

Exploding the server dropdown will list *Applications*, *Resources* and
*Web Services*. From here you can view as well as manage some of these things
from the NetBeans interface. For example, under
`Resources -> JDBC -> Connection Pools -> DerbyPool (right click) -> Properties`
you can change details like the port number.


[[deploying]]
== Deploying Applications to Payara Server

An application can be deployed and undeployed easily from within NetBeans.
First, the application run settings need to be configured to use Payara Server.
Go to *Properties* on a project and then the *Run* section of this window. This
menu lists the configuration for deploying the application.

Select the Payara Server you have configured. You can also select a context path
for the application to be deployed to, as well as NetBeans behaviour when
deploying.

Deploying to Payara Server Community now only requires running the application like any
other NetBeans project. Once it's deployed, the *Services* view will then
display the application under *Payara Server*, where you can *undeploy*,
*enable*, *disable* and view the application in the browser.

[[hot-deploy]]
== Hot Deploy Applications

_Since *5.201*&nbsp;_ Payara Server Community provides the Hot Deployment capability by boosting the performance 
of the application redeployment operation and dynamically replaces the classloader of the application on each redeployment in the hot deploy mode.

The Hot Deploy mode can be enabled in the Apache NetBeans IDE from the *Properties* panel of the Payara Server.

Also, make sure to enable the *Compile on Save* and *Deploy on Save* option from the *Properties* panel of the Project.

NOTE: The Hot Deploy feature is in technical preview and only supported by Maven Web Applications from the Apache NetBeans IDE v11.3.

After enabling the Hot Deploy settings as mentioned above, Simply deploy the Maven Web Applications to Payara Server Community
and modify any Java class of the application to perform the auto redeploy of application on save 
and observer the fast redeployment of the application in Payara Server console log in compare to vanilla redeployment.
