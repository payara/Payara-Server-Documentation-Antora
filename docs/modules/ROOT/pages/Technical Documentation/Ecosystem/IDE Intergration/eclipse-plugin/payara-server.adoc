5. In the last step you can select resources which will be deployed on the server.
  Here we don't have any deployable projects in the workspace yet, so both panels are empty.

[[adding-resources]]

1. First import or create some project, deployable to the *Payara Server*.
  Here we use one of the https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples[Java EE 7 Samples] .
2. Right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Add and Remove...*

5. If the deployment was successful, you can use the application.
  Here we simply opened the internal Eclipse's browser and sent the HTTP GET request - and the application responded.

6. You can also access the administration console directly from the Eclipse Browser.
  Just right click the target server in the *Servers* view and click *Payara -> View Admin Console*

WARNING: Be careful, because changing the runtime may result in unusable state of the server
