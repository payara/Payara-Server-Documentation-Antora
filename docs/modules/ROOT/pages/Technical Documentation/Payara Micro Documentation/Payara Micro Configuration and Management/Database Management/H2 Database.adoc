= H2 Database

H2 is a Java-based Database which replaced Derby as the default database in Payara 5. More info about H2 can be found 
http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[here].
Derby as a database service that can be started and managed by Payara Micro Community, has been removed starting from version 5.201

== Why was Derby Removed?
In terms of performance, Derby is one of the slowest  embedded databases as  
compared to H2, PostgresSQL, HSQLDB. H2 also has a smaller disk footprint; the 
size of a jar file is around 1.5 MB. This should have positive effect on Payara 
Micro's boot time.
