= Deploying Applications From the Command Line

Payara Micro Community supports deploying applications directly from the command line.

[[deploying-an-application]]
== Deploying an Application

As noted in the section
xref:/documentation/payara-micro/starting-instance.adoc#starting-an-instance-from-the-command-line[Starting an Instance],
all Payara Micro actions are run for the Payara Micro JAR, all in one command.

The general structure of starting, configuring, and deploying an application to
an instance is as follows:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --option1 --option2 ...
----

[[persistent-rootdir]]
== Using Persistent Configuration Directory

When xref:documentation/payara-micro/rootdir.adoc[persistent configuration directory] is reused across restarts (i. e. not running in a container), it is recommended not to specify deployment each time Payara Micro is invoked from that directory.
Doing so will cause the application to be deployed twice -- once at startup and second time when deployment section of the command line is processed.

The best approach if your application uses persistent filesystem is to use warmup run for deployment:

[source,shell]
----
# perform deployments and configuration
java -jar payara-micro.jar --rootdir micro-root --warmup application.war

# all further invocations do not specify deployment
java -jar payara-micro.jar --rootdir micro-root
----

Alternatively a launcher can be generated for configured root directory as well:

[source,shell]
----
# perform deployments and configuration
java -jar payara-micro.jar --rootdir micro-root --warmup application.war
java -jar payara-micro.jar --rootdir micro-root --outputlauncher

# all further invocations use parameterless launcher
java -jar micro-root/launch-micro.jar
----


[[deploying-an-application-package]]
== Deploying an Application Package

To deploy a WAR file to an instance, you need to use the `--deploy` option, followed
by the path to the application to deploy. See below for an example of starting a
Payara Micro Community instance and deploying a WAR file:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy /home/user/example.war
----

NOTE: Since 4.1.2.181 and 5.181 the `--deploy` option is optional if your deployment file
ends with `.jar`, `.rar` or `.war` therefore the command line below can also be used
[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar /home/user/example.war
----

[[deploying-an-exploded-war]]
== Deploying an Exploded War

An exploded war can be deployed to a Payara Micro Community instance just be specifying
the path to the exploded war root directory on the `--deploy` command line or
via the API. The exploded war can be redeployed by creating a file _.reload_
in the root directory of the exploded war and updating its timestamp for example
using `touch .reload` in a LINUX machine.

[[deploying-multiple-applications]]
== Deploying Multiple Applications

If you want to deploy multiple applications to an instance with the `--deploy`
option, you must use it once for each application to be deployed; it does not
accept multiple paths.

For example, to deploy 2 applications:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy /home/user/example.war --deploy /home/user/test.war
----

Alternatively, you can use the `--deploymentDir` option. This option specifies
a directory to scan for deployable archives, allowing you to store all of the
applications you wish to be deployed in a directory, and have them be deployed
automatically upon instance startup.

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploymentDir /home/user/deployments
----

[[deploying-applications-from-a-maven-repository]]
== Deploying Applications from a Maven repository

You can deploy an application directly from a Maven repository using the
`--deployFromGAV` option. This option accepts a comma separated string denoting
a Maven artefact's _groupId_, _artifactId_, and _version_ attributes.

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deployFromGAV "fish.payara.examples,test,1.0-SNAPSHOT"
----

This option can be used multiple times, and in conjunction with the standard
`--deploy` options.

By default, Payara Micro will only search for artefacts in the Maven Central
repository. If you wish to search additional repositories, you can add them to
the list of repositories to search with the `--additionalRepository` option:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deployFromGAV "fish.payara.examples,test,1.0-SNAPSHOT" --additionalRepository https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/promoted/
----

To search through multiple additional repositories, you can simply specify the
option multiple times:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deployFromGAV "fish.payara.examples,test,1.0-SNAPSHOT" --additionalRepository https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/promoted/ --additionalRepository https://raw.github.com/payara/Payara_PatchedProjects/master/
----

[[define-context-root]]
== Define context root
The context root of an application can be specified using the option `--contextroot` or by appending the path to the war-file name given with the `--deploy` parameter.

A context root set using the option `--contextroot <context-path>` applies to the applciation of the first `--deploy` parameter that does not already specify a context root with its `--deploy` option.

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy /home/user/example.war --contextroot hello-world
----

The root context of the `example.war` application is now set to `/hello-world`. 

Alternatively the context root can be included in the argument to the `--deploy` option. It follows the path to the war file separated by `File.pathSeparator`:

* `--deploy <war-file>:<context-path>` (Linux uses `:`)
* `--deploy <war-file>;<context-path>` (Windows uses `;`)

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy /home/user/example.war:hello-world
----

The above command again results in the effective root context `/hello-world`.

The two methods can also be used together:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --contextroot bar
    --deploy /home/user/example.war:foo 
    --deploy /home/user/test.war 
----
Here `example.war` is deployed in `/foo` while `test.war` is deployed in `/bar`.

NOTE: `--deploy example.war:` is identical to `--deploy example.war:/` and deploys to the effective context root `/` while `--deploy example.war` deploys to `/example`. 
It follows that leading `/` can be given but aren't required. However, tailing `/` must not be given. Using `--deploy example.war:/foo/` renders the URL `<host>/foo/` inaccessible.
