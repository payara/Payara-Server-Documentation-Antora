[[adding-jars-to-instance]]
= Adding Third-Party JARs to a Micro Instance

_Since Payara Micro 4.1.2.173_

There are multiple scenarios when it's needed to add a third-party library to the
class path of a Payara Micro Community instance:

* Deploying applications that use JDBC resources, which have a need to access the
respective JDBC driver JAR.
* Shared libraries used by multiple applications deployed on the same instance.
* Avoiding the creation of fat application WARs with lots of bundled libraries
to simplify a build-integration pipeline.

Such scenarios are easily solved on Payara Server Community by adding these JAR files at
the domain or modules of the application server library directories. On Payara Micro Community,
this can be done on multiple ways.

[[from-the-command-line]]
== From the command line

In order to add a third-party jar to a new Payara Micro Community instance, use the `--addLibs` argument when starting the instance like this:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --addLibs third-party.jar
----

You can specify a directory instead of a simple JAR to add all of the JARs that
are located in that directory:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --addLibs /home/payara-libs/
----

Finally, in order to add third-party libraries from multiple sources, specify
each source (either a file or directory path) separating them using the colon
character (`:`). Here's a simple example to add 3 sources for libraries:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --addLibs third-party.jar:/opt/application/jars:~/v/mysql-jdbc-driver.jar
----

NOTE: You may notice that this syntax is similar to the syntax used to specify
the classpath using the `-cp` argument when running the JVM.

If you don't like using the previous syntax and prefer a simpler option, you can
repeat the `--addLibs` argument as many times as you want per each JAR source, like
in the following example:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --addLibs third-party.jar --addLibs /opt/application/jars --addLibs ~/v/mysql-jdbc-driver.jar
----

This argument cannot be used when instance is started via xref:documentation/payara-micro/starting-instance.adoc[root directory launcher]. 
It is however accepted when creating a launcher via `--outputlauncher` and provided libraries will be added to launcher's classpath.

[[programmatically-using-api]]
== Programmatically using the API

In order to add third-party libraries to a new Payara Micro Community instance programmatically,
use the `PayaraMicro.addLibrary` method to properly add either JAR files or a directory
of JAR files. You can call the method multiple times to each multiple sources.

For example, to add both a JAR file and a new directory of JAR files to a new instance
use the following code:

[source, java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) throws BootstrapException {
    PayaraMicro instance = PayaraMicro.getInstance();
    instance.addLibrary(new File("~/my-library"));
    instance.addLibrary(new File("~/my-libs/"));
    instance.bootStrap();
}
----

WARNING: Unlike other configuration methods of the `PayaraMicro` class, the
`addLibrary` method *DOES NOT RETURN* a reference to the `PayaraMicro` object,
which means that this method cannot be used for method-chaining style configuration.
This is an issue which will be solved on a future release.

[[packaging-libraries-uber-jar]]
== Packaging Libraries in an Uber JAR

When creating an Uber JAR using the `--outputUberJar` argument from the commmand
line, all specified third-party libraries will be packaged on the resulting JAR.
All added JARS will be located on the _MICRO-INF/lib_ directory.

Here is an example to package 2 JDBC drivers (for MySQL and PostgreSQL) into an
Uber JAR called `my-micro.jar`:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro-4.1.2.173.jar --addLibs postgresql-9.4.1208.jre7.jar:mysql-connector-java-5.1.44-bin.jar --outputUberJar my-micro.jar
----

We can inspect this Uber JAR to verify that the third-party JAR files were packaged
successfully:

[source, shell]
----
> jar -tf my-micro.jar | grep "MICRO-INF/lib"

MICRO-INF/lib/
MICRO-INF/lib/postgresql-9.4.1208.jre7.jar
MICRO-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.44-bin.jar
----
