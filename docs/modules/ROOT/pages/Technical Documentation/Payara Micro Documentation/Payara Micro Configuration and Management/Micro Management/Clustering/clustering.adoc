Payara Micro Community cluster is based on Hazelcast, similarly to Hazelcast clustering in
Payara Server Community. Each node in a Payara Micro cluster is effectively a Hazelcast node.

It makes it easy to scale the infrastructure for our applications dynamically,
without any complex configuration or downtime.
