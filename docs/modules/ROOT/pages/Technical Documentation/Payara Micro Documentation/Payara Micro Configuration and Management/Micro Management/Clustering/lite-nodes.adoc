= Lite Cluster Members

_Since Payara Micro 4.1.1.162_

You may specify on the command line using `--lite` option, or through the API,
that a Payara Micro Community instance is a lite instance. Then the Payara Micro instance
will join the cluster but will not store any clustered data; for example web
session data or JCache data. This is very useful for a number of scenarios.

You can create a cluster topology whereby a web application is hosted in a number
of Payara Micro instances and the garbage collection ergonomics for these instances
are tuned for throughput. In addition, a number of Payara Micro instances can be
in the cluster with no applications deployed and these instances can be tuned for
long-lived web session data. In this case, the web application instances could be
designated as lite cluster members to make sure no web session data is stored
within their JVMs.

IMPORTANT: Lite members can also be used purely if you want a clustered Payara
Micro Community instance to join the same cluster and receive CDI events or clustered events,
but without storing any data.
