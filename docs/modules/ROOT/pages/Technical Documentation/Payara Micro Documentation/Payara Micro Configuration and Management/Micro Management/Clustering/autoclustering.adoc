This section details the auto-clustering feature of Payara Micro.

[[the-multicast-discovery]]
== The Multicast Discovery

The integration of Hazelcast into Payara Micro Community allows instances to automatically,
and dynamically, cluster together. When two instances are pointed at the same
multicast address and port, they will automatically cluster together.

You can see evidence of the automatic clustering by simply starting two instances
(with different HTTP port configurations or use `--autobindhttp`), and you should see the following in the
log output:

[source, log]
----
Members [2] {
Member [192.168.174.130]:5900 this
Member [192.168.174.130]:5901
----

The `--startPort` option is used to determine which clustering port the Payara
Micro instance will *first* try to bind to. If the port is already bound to
(say, by another Payara Micro instance), then the Payara Micro instance will
simply increment the _startPort_ value and try again until it finds a port it
can bind to.

For example, if there are already two Payara Micro instances running, which have
bound ports *5900* and *5901*, then a third instance started with a _startPort_
value of *5900* will first try to bind to *5900*, then to *5901*, then finally
settle on *5902*.

If you wish to have multiple clusters, then you can make use of the
`--mcAddress` and ``--mcPort` options to define a different multicast address
and port; assign a different address and port to each set of instances you wish
to run in a separate cluster and they will automatically make their own cluster
on the new multicast address and port.

TIP: You can also use `--clusterName` and `--clusterPassword` to segregate clusters.

[[preventing-cluster-cross-talk]]
=== Preventing Multicast Cluster Cross Talk

By default Payara Micro Community clusters automatically discover other cluster members
via multicast. This can lead to the situation whereby different development environments
being used by different teams cluster together as they are using the same multicast
address and multicast port.

This can lead to confusing errors. To prevent cluster cross-talk make sure that
the multicast-address and multicast-port are set to different values on each unique
cluster. In the case where this is not possible, Payara Micro Community provides the ability
to set a cluster name and a cluster password both through the command line or
through the API.

If all the multicast settings are similar, instances will only cluster together
if all the instances have the same cluster name and cluster password.

[[other-forms-of-discovery]]
== Other forms of discovery

_Since Payara Micro 5.181_

With the introduction of the xref:/documentation/payara-server/hazelcast/Overview.adoc[Domain Data Grid]
Payara Micro now includes a number of alternative discovery modes configurable on the command line
using the `--clustermode` command line option. The default cluster mode is multicast as described above.

=== Domain Discovery Mode
Domain Discovery Mode enables a Payara Micro Community instance to join a Domain Data Grid managed
by a Payara Server DAS containing Payara Server Instances. To join a Domain Data Grid
start Payara Micro with the domain cluster mode:
[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --clustermode domain:192.168.0.64:4900
----

The format of the domain cluster mode is `domain:ip:port` where `ip` is the ip address
that the Hazelcast instance is bound to in the DAS.

NOTE: Hazelcast is very particular about the IP address used to join a cluster.
The IP Address should be exactly as reported by the details

When the DAS starts it will log a message like:

[source, log]
----
Data Grid Status
Payara Data Grid State: DG Version: 35 DG Size: 2
Instances: {
Address: /192.168.0.104:4900 UUID: 7c1bd6ca-1574-4e38-9189-effcd4ccafd2 Lite: false This: true Name: server Group: server-config
Address: /192.168.0.104:5900 UUID: 0f6887b2-9932-4085-a6f8-e40751269023 Lite: false This: false
}
----

This shows the IP address and ports that can be used as input into the domain cluster mode.

NOTE: If you accidentally choose the DAS admin port (by default 4848) as the cluster port you will get a warning like

[source,log]
----
[2018-03-08T13:51:46.446+0000] [] [WARNING] [] [fish.payara.nucleus.hazelcast.DomainDiscoveryService] [tid: _ThreadID=1 _ThreadName=main] [timeMillis: 1520517106446] [levelValue: 900] You have specified 4848 as the datagrid domain port however this is the default DAS admin port, the default domain datagrid port is 4900
----

=== TCPIP Discovery Mode
The TCPIP Discovery Mode can be used to cluster Payara Micro Community instances when Multicast
is not available on the network. This is especially useful in Cloud environments or
in containerized deployments like Docker and Kubernetes. For the TCPIP discovery mode
you specify a comma separated list of `ip:port` adddresses where you believe other Payara Micros will be listening.

For example the following command will cluster two Payara Micros together when multicast is not available.
[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --clustermode tcpip:192.168.0.104:6900,192.168.0.104:6901

java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --clustermode tcpip:192.168.0.104:6900,192.168.0.104:6901
----

A range of IP addresses can be specified in the list of members for example: `192.168.1.0-7:6900`.
This is especially useful if you have a cloud VPC and you have a number of Payara Micro instances
running across a number of Cloud VMs. Using a range is also useful in Docker environments where the
range of IP Addresses is known but dynamic for example `172.17.0.2-8:6900`.

During discovery Payara Micro Community will test each IP:Port combination until it finds another
Payara Micro instance. As long as one instance exists then it will join the existing cluster.
If no Payra Micro instances are contactable the instance will create a new cluster with itself
as the single member.

NOTE: Hazelcast is very particular about the IP address used to join a cluster.
The IP Address should be exactly as reported by the details

NOTE: TCPIP cluster mode can also be used to join a Payara Server Domain Data Grid
by specifying the ip:port of the DAS Hazelcast instance.

=== DNS Discovery Mode

_Since Payara Server 5.184_

The DNS Discovery mode can be used to cluster Payara Micro Community instances by specifying a DNS name. Similar to the
TCPIP discovery mode, this discovery mode takes a comma separated list of DNS A/AAAA record names and ports to
determine  where to look for instances to cluster with.

----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --clustermode dns:localhost:6900,ubuntu:6900,suse:6900
----

IMPORTANT: If there are multiple IP addresses associated with a DNS name, Payara Micro will attempt to cluster
with all of them.

=== Kubernetes Discovery Mode

_Since Payara Micro 5.184_

The Kubernetes Disocvery mode can be used to cluster Payara Micro Community instances running in a kubernetes cluster,
which can be useful due to the variable networking inherent to kubernetes. When using this discovery mode, the default
settings will make Payara Micro attempt to cluster with instances present on pods within the default namespace.

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --clustermode kubernetes
----

Optionally, you can provide a kubernetes namespace and service name separated by a comma - Payara Micro will then
attempt to cluster with instances present on pods within the specified namespace and service. If using this latter
option, you must provide both a namespace and service name - the options cannot be used individually.

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --clustermode kubernetes:default,service1
----

This clustering is done using the Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin, and so you will need to grant Hazelcast
permission to query the kubernetes master. As per the plugin documentation, you will need to apply the
following permissions using `kubectl apply`:

[source, shell]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: default-cluster
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: view
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: default
  namespace: default
----

See the original documentation on configuring these permissions
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-kubernetes#grating-permissions-to-use-kubernetes-api[here], as well as
extra documentation on how to restrict these permissions further
https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast#configuration[here].

=== Interfaces

If Hazelcast chooses the incorrect IP Address to bind to (for example a docker interface)
the `--interfaces` command line option can be used to force Hazelcast to use the specified
network interface for Hazelcast:
[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autobindhttp --clustermode tcpip:192.168.0.104:6900,192.168.0.104:6901 --interfaces 192.168.0.104
----

=== Advanced Discovery Modes
Further Discovery Modes can be configured directly in a hazelcast configuration file
passed to Payara Micro Community using the `--hzconfigfile` command line option. Review the
Hazelcast documentation to configure Hazelcast using this file.
