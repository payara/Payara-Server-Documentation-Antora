= HTTP and HTTPS Auto-Binding

Payara Micro Community supports an auto-binding feature for its HTTP and HTTPS port,
allowing Payara Micro Community to dynamically find a free HTTP or HTTPS port as required
during startup.

This feature is controlled through these three options:

`--autoBindHttp`:: Enables auto-bind functionality for the HTTP port
`--autoBindSsl`:: Enables auto-bind functionality for the HTTPS port
`--autoBindRange`:: Sets the range for the auto-bind feature

When auto-binding is enabled, Payara Micro will attempt to connect to the port
specified with the `--port` or `--sslPort` option (or, if these options are not
specified, to port *8080* and *8181* respectively), and if that port is busy,
it will instead try to bind on the next port up, repeating this process until
it finds a free port, or the `--autoBindRange` limiter is reached.

For example, if ports *8080* and *8081* were busy, and ports *8082* and *8182*
were free, then starting Payara Micro Community with the following command would have the
HTTP port bind to *8082* and the HTTPS port bind to *8182*:

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --autoBindHttp --sslPort 8181 --autoBindSsl
----

Whereas the following would fail to start in the same situation because
`--autoBindRange` is not large enough (no free port within the range of
**8080**-**8081**):

[source, shell]
----
java -jar payara-micro.jar --port 8080 --autoBindHttp --sslPort 8181 --autoBindSsl --autoBindRange 1
----

WARNING: Be aware that the auto-bind feature does not currently read port values from 
domain.xml files; if the `--port` and `--sslPort` options are not used, then
the `--autoBindHttp` and `--autoBindSsl` options will assume that the HTTP and
HTTPS ports will be at the default values of 8080 and 8181 respectively.
