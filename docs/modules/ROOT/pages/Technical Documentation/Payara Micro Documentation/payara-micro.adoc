This section covers how to use Payara Micro Community.

release. It allows you to deploy and run WAR files from the command line with
a single command, and also features automatic, dynamic clustering with Hazelcast.

== Documentation Conventions

. Any commands listed will be written assuming they are being run from the same
directory as the Payara Micro JAR file.
. Any commands listed will also be written assuming that the system environment
variables have been set up to have Java on the system Path.
. Any paths listed throughout the documentation will use the Unix/Linux file
path structure (forward slashes).
. The owning class of an API method will not be explicitly stated unless it is
not clear if an instance has been started or not; methods that operate on Payara
Micro instances before they have been bootstrapped (instances that have not
yet been started) are contained in the `PayaraMicro` class, whereas methods
that operate on bootstrapped instances (running instances) are contained
within the `PayaraMicroRuntime` class.
