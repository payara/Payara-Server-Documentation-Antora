== Artifacts in Maven Central

Payara Micro Community has been uploaded to Maven Central, allowing you to include
it as a dependency in your POM.

This allows you to easily add the required Payara Micro classes and
methods to your application to use Payara Micro Community programmatically.

In your project's POM, include the following dependency:

[source, xml, subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>fish.payara.extras</groupId>
    <artifactId>payara-micro</artifactId>
    <version>{currentVersion}</version>
</dependency>

`${payara.version}` is a Maven property, which specifies the version of the Maven
artifact, e.g. {currentVersion}.
