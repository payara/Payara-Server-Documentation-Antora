== Logging to a file from the Command Line

To print all of the Payara Micro log messages into a file from the command line,
you will need to use the `--logToFile` option, followed by either a path to
where you want to put the log file or by giving the name of a file you want to
print the logs into. If a file name is not given, a default file called
_payara-server.log_ is generated.
