= Running Callable Objects on Bootstrapped Instances

Like with running asadmin commands, there are two methods available for running
`Callable` objects, both also named `run`.

The two methods also work in a similar way to the two asadmin run methods:

`run(Callable<T> callable)`::
runs the specified Callable on all instances in a runtime's cluster.
`run(Collection<InstanceDescriptor>`::
members, Callable<T> callable)` runs the Callable on a subset of the instances
in a runtime's cluster.

Both methods return a `Map` object with a key/value type of
`<InstanceDescriptor, Future<T>>`, where the type variable _T_ is Serializable.
