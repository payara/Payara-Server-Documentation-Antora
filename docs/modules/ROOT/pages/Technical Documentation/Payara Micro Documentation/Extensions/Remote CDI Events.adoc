= Remote CDI Events in Payara Micro

_Since Payara Micro 4.1.1.153_

Payara Micro Community can listen to and fire CDI events across the cluster of Payara Micro
instances, and also across Payara Server instances within the same cluster.
Payara Micro supports the same functionality for
xref:/documentation/payara-server/public-api/cdi-events.adoc[remote CDI events]
as provided by Payara Server.

Payara Micro also provides additional methods to fire events and register listeners
programmatically. You can view the methods associated with CDI Events in the
xref:/documentation/payara-micro/appendices/operation-methods.adoc#cdi-methods[appendices].

NOTE: This feature has been available in Payara Micro long before it was available in
Payara Server.

[[manual-initialization-of-the-event-bus]]
== Manual initialization of the Event Bus

_Since Payara Micro 4.1.1.171_

On prior releases, it was necessary to initialize the event bus using
`ClusteredCDIEventBus.initialize()` manually upon startup. Although this method
is still available in the API, it is not necessary anymore, since the event bus
is automatically initialized after an application is started.
