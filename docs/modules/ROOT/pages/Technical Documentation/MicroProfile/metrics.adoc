[[microprofile-metrics]]
= Eclipse MicroProfile Metrics API

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.181 and 5.181_

Provided version of the API: {mpMetricsSpecUrl}[MicroProfile Metrics {mpMetricsVersion}]

The Metrics API was designed to provide monitoring support for applications as well as the underlying runtime. This is considered separate to ***health checks*** which are concerned with a binary status of "healthy" or "unhealthy". In design, the Metrics API has borrowed heavily from DropWizard Metrics, so many of the concepts in the API will be familiar.

For a full overview of the API, review https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/releases[the documentation for the appropriate release.]

A key goal of the specification was to provide HTTP endpoints in Prometheus format (as well as JSON). Since the https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-format-details[Prometheus Text format] is widely used by monitoring products other than Prometheus, this gives a lot of compatibility out-of-the-box.

{mpMetricsSpecUrl}[MicroProfile Metrics 1.1] was released in MicroProfile 1.3
