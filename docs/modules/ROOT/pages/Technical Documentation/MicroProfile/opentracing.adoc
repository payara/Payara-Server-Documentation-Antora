= Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.182 and 5.182_

Provided version of the API: {mpOpenTracingSpecUrl}[MicroProfile Open Tracing {mpOpenTracingVersion}]

[[background]]
== Background

The Open Tracing API was created to allow easier tracing of the flow of a request in microservices environment across service boundaries.

A full overview for the reasoning behind the API can be found in https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/blob/master/Overview.adoc[the Overview of the MicroProfile OpenTracing source code repository].

{mpOpenTracingSpecUrl}[The complete specification] is maintained in the same repository.

[[text-and-binary-carriers]]
== Text and Binary Carriers Support

_Since Payara Platform 4.1.2.183 and 5.183_

The Payara Platform implementation of the `io.opentracing.Tracer` interface supports the following carriers:

* `TextMap` carriers with `HTTP_HEADERS` and `TEXT_MAP` formats 
* `ByteBuffer` carriers that use the `BINARY` format

[[jax-ws-support]]
== JAX-WS Support

_Since Payara Server 5.192_

The Payara Platform's MicroProfile implementation supports tracing of requests that are handled by SOAP Web Services implemented via the JAX-WS API. Since JAX-WS is only supported on Payara Server Full Profile, this support is not covered on Payara Micro.

[[opentracing-configuration]]
=== OpenTracing Configuration

You can configure the notifiers and open tracing service by using the xref:/documentation/payara-server/request-tracing-service/asadmin-commands.adoc[asadmin commands] and also using the xref:/documentation/payara-server/request-tracing-service/configuration.adoc[Administration console].

[[alternative-implementation]]
== Using Alternate Opentracing Implementations

_Since Payara Server 5.194_

If you wish to use an alternative implementation of OpenTracing, i.e. Jaeger, then the alternative implementation must be provided as a jar in the lib directory of your domain. In it must be a file named `io.opentracing.Tracer` under _META-INF/services_, with the name of the class implementing `io.opentracing.Tracer`. That implementation must have a no-argument constructor. Alternate Opentracing implementations will only trace JAX-RS, JAX-WS and classes or methods annotated with `@Traced`; Payara's own request tracing service can trace xref:/documentation/payara-server/request-tracing-service/request-tracing-service.adoc[more types of request]. Payara's request tracing service MUST also be enabled, whichever implementation is being used in order for tracing to occur. All other configuration within Payara's request tracing service will have no effect on the supplied tracer, which must be configured separately to Payara.

Activating Request Tracing is done either via the admin console or using the commands:

`set-requesttracing-configuration --enabled=true --dynamic=true`
`bootstrap-requesttracing`

NOTE: All other options for request tracing are ignored as the created Spans are not processed within Payara.

As an example, see https://github.com/payara/ecosystem-jaeger-tracing, which shows how to integrate a Jaeger client tracer. This can be added as a library to Payara with the command `add-library jaeger-tracer-lib-with-dependencies`. Enabling request tracing in Payara Server is then required, which will then send traces from OpenTracing to a Jaeger collector on the same host.
