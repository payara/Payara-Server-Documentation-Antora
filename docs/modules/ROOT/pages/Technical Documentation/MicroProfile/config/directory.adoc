= Directory Config Source

== Configuration

Config Directory can be configured by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

_Since *5.184*&nbsp;_

=== Using the Admin Console

To configure the Config Directory in the Admin Console, go to Configuration
→ [instance-configuration (like server-config)] → MicroProfile → Config → Directory:

=== Using Asadmin Commands

==== `set-config-dir`

:previewVersion: 4.1.2.181
include::partial$tech-preview.adoc[]

*Usage*::
`asadmin> set-config-dir --directory=<full.path.to.dir> --target=<target[default:server]>`

*Aim*::
Sets the directory to be used for the directory config source.
- *Leaf directory cannot start with a dot*, rendering `/home/payara/.secret`
  an invalid path ("." means hidden on a POSIX filesystem).
- If relative, will lookup beneath server instance location
  (usually to be found at `<PAYARA-HOME>/glassfish/domains/<DOMAIN>/`)
- Defaults to `secrets`, targeting `<PAYARA-HOME>/glassfish/domains/<DOMAIN>/secrets/`

_Please note:_ after setting via `asadmin`, you will need to _restart_ the
application server to reinitialize the config source!

=== Using Preboot or Postboot Scripts
Especially when running Payara in a container, there is no way to restart after
configuring via an `asadmin` command without loosing the domain configuration.

Thus you should add the command to a bootscript as described at
xref:documentation/payara-micro/asadmin/pre-and-post-boot-scripts.adoc[Pre- and Postboot scripts].
See xref:documentation/ecosystem/docker-server-usage.adoc#_environment_variables[Payara Server container image env vars]
for details how to use this within non-micro flavored containers.


== Usage

Usually this config source is used to map secrets mounted by Kubernetes or
Docker to a directory inside a running container.

Once you configured a directory to read a config (secrets) from, you need to
make sure file names correspond to properties in your codebase.

=== Map property names to flat file hierarchy

_Since *5.183*&nbsp;_

1. Say you have two properties `property1` and `foo.bar.property2`.
2. Payara is configured with secret directory `/home/payara/secrets`
3. Secrets mounted as files to `/home/payara/secrets/property1` and
   `/home/payara/secrets/foo.bar.property2` will be read.

Remember that the files may only contain the secret or other configuration
value - no newlines, metadata, etc! Plaintext files only, no file extensions
allowed.

=== Map property names to a sub-directory structure

_Since *5.2021.1*&nbsp;_

1. Say you have two properties `property1` and `foo.bar.property2`.
2. Payara is configured with secret directory `/home/payara/secrets`
3. Secrets mounted as files to `/home/payara/secrets/property1` and
   `/home/payara/secrets/foo/bar/property2` will be read.

Restrictions on the files content are the same as with the flat hierarchy.

Updates to files and subdirectories are picked up at runtime. Retrieving
the config property again will use the updated values. This allows for clearing
a value by removing the file, too.

==== Dots usage and depicting directories and file name

Dots in property names are used to reflect scopes, for example to distinguish
different applications, modules, etc.

1. Any dots in the property name may correspond to changing from one directory
   to a subdirectory.
   Example: `foo.bar.test` could be a file `test` in `foo/bar/` path.
2. You may combine any number of dot-separated "components" into directories
   and file name.
   Example: `foo.bar.test.example` may be a file `test.example` in
   `foo/bar/` path or a file `example` in path `foo/bar.test/` and so on.
3. Do not use a file extension, as it would be taken as part of the
   property name.
4. The longest, most specific match "wins" for reading the value into the
   property. This allows to create scoped directory structures as you see fit.
   Example: `foo.bar/test.example` is less specific than `foo/bar/test.example`
   and so on.

You cannot use directories or files whose names start with a dot. They will
be ignored, following the POSIX philosophy of hidden files and folders.

Symlinks will be followed, so you can expose files from such hidden areas,
allowing for all types of mangling with names etc. (This allows the Kubernetes
Secret mounting magic to happen...) Don't symlink to directories, as the
file monitors rely on real directories.

==== Kubernetes Example

You want to retrieve a (secret) value via property `foo.bar.property1`:

[source,Java]
----
@ConfigProperty("foo.bar.property1")
----

You deployed a secret to your Kubernetes cluster:

[source,Yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: foobar
type: Opaque
stringData:
  property1: my-super-secret-value
----

And your pod mounts it at `/home/payara/secrets/foo/bar`
(only showing the relevant parts from the `Deployment` K8s YAML):

[source,Yaml]
----
volumeMounts:
  - name: test-secrets
    mountPath: /home/payara/secrets/foo/bar
volumes:
  - name: test-secret
    secret:
      secretName: foobar
----

[source]
----
/ # ls -la /home/payara/secrets/foo/bar
total 3
drwxrwxrwt 3 root root  120 Nov 25 10:51 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 25 10:51 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   80 Nov 25 10:51 ..2020_11_25_10_51_55.283009570
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   31 Nov 25 10:51 ..data -> ..2020_11_25_10_51_55.283009570
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   15 Nov 25 10:51 property1 -> ..data/property1
----

Now Payara will pick up the file and read its content as a value for property
`foo.bar.property1`
