= Password Aliases Overview

By default, passwords within Payara Server Community are treated like any other property
and are stored in plaintext. Passwords stored in plaintext are a security
risk, as you can directly read them, unencrypted and unobstructed.

A *password alias* allows you to have a plaintext reference to an encrypted
password stored on the server, with the alias being used wherever the
password is needed.

[[using-password-alias-admin-console]]
== Using a password alias within the Admin Console

To use a password alias, navigate to any configuration view where you would
have previously entered a password in plaintext format:

In place of the password, you can enter an alias which corresponds to the password
in the form: `${ALIAS=<password-alias-name>}`:

To create a password alias from the admin console, read the instructions detailed
xref:/documentation/payara-server/password-aliases/password-alias-admin-console-commands.adoc[here].

[[using-password-alias-command-line]]
== Using a password alias on the command line

On the command line, when using `asadmin` commands where you would previously
have entered a password, you can instead enter the password placeholder `${ALIAS=<example-alias-name>}`
to avoid having passwords stored in the configuration in plain text.

Here is an example of setting the user's password for a JDBC connection pool:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> create-jdbc-connection-pool [...] --property password=${ALIAS=<example-alias-name} [...]
----

To create a password alias from command line, read the instructions detailed
xref:/documentation/payara-server/password-aliases/password-alias-asadmin-commands.adoc[here].

[[using-password-alias-microprofile]]
== MicroProfile Config support

Password aliases can also be accessed using MicroProfile Config, as detailed xref:/documentation/microprofile/config/Overview.adoc[here].
