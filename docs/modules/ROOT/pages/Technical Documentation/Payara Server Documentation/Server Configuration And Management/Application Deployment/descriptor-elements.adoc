This page is a reference for extra and changed elements added to the GlassFish proprietary
deployment descriptors


[[classloading-delegate]]
== `classloading-delegate`

With this option its possible to enable/disable *class loading delegation*.
This allows deployed application to use libraries included on them,
overriding the versions included on the server.

For more information about how class delegation can be configured on
Payara Server Community, see the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/classloading.adoc[Enhanced Class loading] section.

[[clustered-attach-postconstruct]]
== `clustered-attach-postconstruct`

Whether to call `@PostConstruct` each time the bean is created
on a different node. Will result in multiple calls.

Valid values are `true` or `false`. The default value is `true`.

[[clustered-bean]]
== `clustered-bean`

Whether this bean should be a xref:/documentation/payara-server/public-api/clustered-singleton.adoc[Clustered Singleton]. Can be applied only to singleton EJBs.

Valid values are `true` or `false`. The default value is `false`.

[[clustered-detach-predestroy]]
== `clustered-detach-predestroy`

Whether to call `@PreDestroy` when the singleton is destroyed on an
instance while still being available on another. Will result in
multiple calls.

Valid values are `true` or `false`. The default value is `true`.

[[clustered-key-name]]
== `clustered-key-name`

The key used for replication of clustered beans. Applies to singleton EJBs when `clustered-bean` is set to `true`.

This element is optional. If not set, the default value is the value of the `ejb-name` element.

[[clustered-lock-type]]
== `clustered-lock-type`

The type of distributed locking to be performed. 

For EJB beans, only `INHERIT` and `LOCK_NONE` are valid.

For CDI beans, valid values are `LOCK` and `INHERIT`, which is equivalent to using `LOCK_NONE`.

Default value is `INHERIT`

[[whitelist-package]]
== `whitelist-package`

Used to whitelist packages on xref:/documentation/payara-server/classloading.adoc#extreme-classloading-isolation[*extreme class loading isolation*].
Whitelisted packages are taken into account by the server when scanning
libraries.

For more information about how extreme class loading isolation works on
Payara Server Community, see the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/classloading.adoc[Enhanced Classloading] section.

[[enable-implicit-cdi]]
== `enable-implicit-cdi`

In a *WAR* file, it is possible to set the property `bean-discovery-mode`
equal to `none` to turn off implicit scanning of the archive for bean
defining annotations, as defined by the _CDI 1.1_ specification. The
default value of this setting is defined as `annotated` in the specification,
so the archive is scanned for any bean-defining annotations, which can cause
unwanted side effects.

In the `glassfish-application.xml` deployment descriptor for an EAR
file, the property `enable-implicit-cdi` can be set to `false` to
achieve the same goal for all modules inside the EAR assembly. The
default value is `true`, in line with the default value for WAR files.

If implicit CDI scanning causes problems for an EAR assembly, the value
`false` will disable implicit CDI scanning for all CDI modules inside
the EAR assembly:

[source, xml]
----
<glassfish-application>
  <enable-implicit-cdi>false</enable-implicit-cdi>
</glassfish-application>
----

The default behavior of the admin console is for the *Implicit CDI*
checkbox to be enabled, but this will *not* override the application
configuration.

IMPORTANT: When implicit CDI is configured by using either the
`enable-implicit-cdi` property in the `glassfish-application.xml` or the
attribute `bean-discovery-mode="none"` from the `beans.xml` file in a
WAR, the admin console checkbox _*is always ignored*_.

[[scanning-exclude-and-scanning-include]]
== `scanning-exclude` and `scanning-include`

Modern WAR and EAR files very often include a number of 3rd party JARs.
In situations where some JARs require CDI scanning and others may break
if scanned, these can now be explicitly included or excluded from such
component scanning.

Both the `glassfish-application.xml` and the `glassfish-web.xml` files
support the following directives:

[source, xml]
----
<scanning-exclude>*</scanning-exclude>
<scanning-include>ejb*</scanning-include>
<scanning-include>conflicting-web-library</scanning-include>
----

In the above example, all JARs will be excluded by default, then all
JARs beginning with `ejb` will be scanned along with the JAR named
`conflicting-web-library`.

[[container-initializer-enabled]]
== `container-initializer-enabled`

This property configures whether to enable or disable the calling of
`ServletContainerInitializer` component classes defined in JAR files
bundled inside a WAR assembly.

For performance considerations, you can explicitly disable the servlet
container initializer by setting the `container-initializer-enabled`
element to `false`. This can help solve the deployment of web applications
that can suffer from conflicts with a custom bootstrapping process.

The default value for this configuration element is `true`.

[[default-role-mapping]]
== `default-role-mapping`

With this property, you can set whether to enable the default group to
role mappings for your application's security settings. This element is
set up as a `property` element with a `Boolean` value attribute like
this:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="default-role-mapping" value="true">
  <description>Enable default group to role mapping</description>
</property>
----

Enabling the default group to role mappings will cause all named groups
in the application's linked security _realm_ to be mapped to a role of the
same name. This will save you the time of having to redefine the same
roles and map them to the realm groups each time they are modified.

This will have the same effect as executing the following `asadmin`
command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin set configs.config.server-config.security-service.activate-default-principal-to-role-mapping=true
----

Except its effect will only limit itself to the application instead of
all applications deployed on the server.

The default value of this property is `false`. This property can be set
in the `glassfish-web.xml`, `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml` and
`glassfish-application.xml` deployment descriptors.

In an EAR assembly, only the property set in the
`glassfish-application.xml` will take effect and if set in the
`glassfish-web.xml` and `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`, it will be ignored.
Setting this configuration property in any of these files will always take
precedence over any setting configured on the server.

[[jaxrs-roles-allowed-enabled]]
== `jaxrs-roles-allowed-enabled`

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.181; 5.181_

Payara Server and Micro since versions *4.1.2.181* and *5.181* support `@RolesAllowed` out of the box to secure JAX-RS resources.

In some cases this may clash with existing code that interprets the same annotation using custom code.

The out-of-the-box support of `@RolesAllowed` for JAX-RS resources can be switched off by setting the `<jaxrs-roles-allowed-enabled>` tag in `WEB-INF/glassfish-web.xml` of a war archive to `false`. E.g. 

[source, xml]
----
<jaxrs-roles-allowed-enabled>false</jaxrs-roles-allowed-enabled>
----


[[max-wait-time-in-millis]]
== `max-wait-time-in-millis`

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.172_

Payara Server has re-implemented a property of the `glassfish-ejb-jar.xml`
descriptor that was available in GlassFish in versions prior to 4.0.

The `bean-pool` element allows users to specify controls on a per-EJB basis for
pooled stateless EJBs. Payara Server has reintroduced `max-wait-time-in-millis`
to govern what happens when the number of requests for an EJB exceeds the number
of beans available in the pool.

A value of `-1` disables the property and means that, when the pool is at
maximum usage and another request is made, a new EJB instance is created
immediately, with no upper bound.

A value of `0` means the server will wait indefinitely for an existing EJB
instance to be freed.

A value between `1` and `MAX_INTEGER` means that the server will wait for the
given amount of milliseconds for an EJB to be freed. Only after this
`max-wait-time-in-millis` is exceeded will the server create a new instance of
the requested EJB.

For more detail, see the xref:/documentation/payara-server/ejb/Overview.adoc[Enhanced EJB configuration] section.

[[webservice-default-login-config]]
== `webservice-default-login-config`

_Since Payara Server 4.1.2.173_

When declaring a secured Web Service based on an EJB using the _glassfish-ejb-jar.xml_
deployment descriptor, it's necessary to define the login configuration (authentication
method, security realm name, etc.) for each EJB Web Service that is secured inside
the assembly. For example, if an application contains 2 EJB web services called
*EJBWS1* and *EJBWS2*, and they need to be secured using `BASIC` authentication against
the _file_ security realm, the following configuration would be needed:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE glassfish-ejb-jar PUBLIC "-//GlassFish.org//DTD GlassFish Application Server 3.1 EJB 3.1//EN" "http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-ejb-jar_3_1-1.dtd">
<glassfish-ejb-jar>
  <ejb>
    <ejb-name>EJBWS1</ejb-name>
    <webservice-endpoint>
      <port-component-name>EJBWS1Port</port-component-name>
      <endpoint-address-uri>EJBWS1/EJBWebService</endpoint-address-uri>
      <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        <realm>file</realm>
      </login-config>
    </webservice-endpoint>
  </ejb>
  <ejb>
    <ejb-name>EJBWS2</ejb-name>
    <webservice-endpoint>
      <port-component-name>EJBWS2Port</port-component-name>
      <endpoint-address-uri>EJBWS2/EJBWebService</endpoint-address-uri>
      <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        <realm>file</realm>
      </login-config>
    </webservice-endpoint>
  </ejb>
</glassfish-ejb-jar>
----

Notice that the `login-config` element is repeated exactly like it is in the 2 EJB
definitions. Not only that, but if these Web services are defined using annotations
for each EJB component, then the *JAX-WS* information (Port Component Name, Endpoint
Address, etc.) would be duplicated too, which is too cumbersome for cases when
there are lots of EJB Web service definitions.

For this scenario, the `webservice-default-login-config` has been introduced to
simplify this configuration. When this element is declared, the login configuration
inside it will apply to all of the EJB defined Web Services by default.

The previous example can be simplified like this:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE glassfish-ejb-jar PUBLIC "-//GlassFish.org//DTD GlassFish Application Server 3.1 EJB 3.1//EN" "http://glassfish.org/dtds/glassfish-ejb-jar_3_1-1.dtd">
<glassfish-ejb-jar>
  <webservice-default-login-config>
      <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
      <realm>file</realm>
  </webservice-default-login-config>
</glassfish-ejb-jar>
----

NOTE: All sub-elements tags of the `login-config` can be used inside this element.

IMPORTANT: If an EJB Web service definition needs a different login configuration
from the default, just redefine it as shown in the example and it will override
the default configuration.

[[jsp-config]]
== `jsp-config`

_Since Payara Server 5.181_

The default value of the _compiler_ property for this element has changed from _1.5_ to _1.8_, denoting a change from JDK5 to JDK8.

You can change this to another value by editing the `jsp-config` element in the `glassfish-web.xml` file.
