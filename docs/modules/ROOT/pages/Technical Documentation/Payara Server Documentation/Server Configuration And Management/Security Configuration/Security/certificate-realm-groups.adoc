[[configure-dn-parts-used-for-groups]]
= Configure Using Distinguished Name Parts for Groups

_Since Payara Server 5.194_

Since Payara 5.194 you can also configure mapping of client certificate's distinguished name to groups, used for
mapping to roles, used for authorization.

This feature can be configured by the property named `dn-parts-used-for-groups` of any security realm of type `com.sun.enterprise.security.auth.realm.certificate.CertificateRealm`.
This property can contain a comma separated list of identifiers of DN parts, ie. `EMAILADDRESS,DC,OU`,
and it is empty by default.
The default empty value means that only content of `assign-groups` property value will be used as the list
of assigned groups.

If both properties are set, a principal who passed the certificate validation will have all groups from
both `assign-groups` value and those mapped from the certificate DN as configured here.

For mapping are usable only DN parts from the following table, other will be ignored:

[[configure-dn-parts-used-for-groups-server]]
== Configuration of the Payara Server

[[configure-dn-parts-using-the-web-admin-console]]
=== Using the Web Admin Console

This feature can be configured on the default certificate realm as follows on the Web administration console:

. Navigate to the applicable configuration page for your use (e.g. `server-config`) under the `Configurations`
  option in the side menu
. Head to `Security` -> `Realms` and select the `certificate` realm
. Click the `Add Property` button
. Set the property _Name_ to be `dn-parts-used-for-groups` and set the _Value_ to a comma separated list of OID names.

[[configure-dn-parts-using-asadmin-utility]]
=== Using an `asadmin` command

You can also use the following asadmin command to set the value of the property through:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set configs.config.${YOUR_INSTANCE_CONFIG}.security-service.auth-realm.certificate.property.dn-parts-used-for-groups=EMAILADDRESS,DC,OU
----

IMPORTANT: After setting the value of the property, make sure that you **restart the server instance** for the changes
to take effect.

[[using-dn-parts-as-groups-in-applications]]
== Using `DN` parts as Groups in Applications

When we configured realm to use parts of distinguished name for groups, and maybe even
xref:documentation//payara-server/server-configuration/security/certificate-realm-principal-name.adoc[using CN as principal name],
we can also map these groups to roles.

The mapping is done in standard way by other server components, but let's summarize some set of rules:

* principal receives principal name as configured (whole DN or only CN part)
* principal receives all groups from realm's `assign-groups` list
* principal receives all groups from certificate's DN parts listed in `dn-parts-used-for-groups` realm property
  (limited to those listed in table)
* server allows the principal to access the application
* client receives all roles from application's security role mapping, where at least one of his principal names
  or groups matches their respective element.
* roles are used for authorization to access application resources

For example, if user authorization roles were mapped like this in the `payara-web.xml` deployment descriptor and we
enabled using `CN` as a principal name and set the `dn-parts-used-for-groups` to `OU`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE payara-web-app PUBLIC "-//Payara.fish//DTD Payara Server 4 Servlet 3.0//EN" "https://docs.payara.fish/schemas/payara-web-app_4.dtd">
<payara-web-app error-url="">
  <context-root>/health-services</context-root>
  <security-role-mapping>
    <role-name>role1</role-name>
    <principal-name>C=UK, S=lak, L=zak, OU=unitA, CN=foo1</principal-name>
    <principal-name>C=UK, S=lak, L=zak, OU=unitA, CN=foo2</principal-name>
    <principal-name>C=UK, S=lak, L=zak, OU=unitC, CN=foo4</principal-name>
    <principal-name>C=UK, S=lak, L=zak, OU=unitD, CN=foo-director</principal-name>
  </security-role-mapping>
  <security-role-mapping>
    <role-name>role2</role-name>
    <principal-name>C=UK, S=lak, L=zak, OU=unitB, CN=foo3</principal-name>
    <principal-name>C=UK, S=lak, L=zak, OU=unitD, CN=foo-director</principal-name>
  </security-role-mapping>
</payara-web-app>
----

Then the role mapping can be based on organizational unit in this case. But you can still use the principal name too:

[source,xml]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE payara-web-app PUBLIC "-//Payara.fish//DTD Payara Server 4 Servlet 3.0//EN" "https://docs.payara.fish/schemas/payara-web-app_4.dtd">
<payara-web-app error-url="">
  <context-root>/health-services</context-root>
  <security-role-mapping>
    <role-name>role1</role-name>
    <group-name>unitA</group-name>
    <group-name>unitC</group-name>
    <group-name>unitD</group-name>
  </security-role-mapping>
  <security-role-mapping>
    <role-name>role2</role-name>
    <group-name>unitB</group-name>
    <principal-name>foo-director</principal-name>
  </security-role-mapping>
</payara-web-app>
----

You have to use the `dn-parts-used-for-groups` property wisely - the set of values must be predictable to be useful.
If you decided to use more ids to filter out group names from a distinguished name, it can cause some group name collisions, ie you can have a state UK and also organisational unit UK, then principal would have a single group UK.
All parsed groups are equal.

The role mapping then works in the same way. It does not matter if it was mapped via principal name or any group name.
If any rule matched, the principal has the role.
