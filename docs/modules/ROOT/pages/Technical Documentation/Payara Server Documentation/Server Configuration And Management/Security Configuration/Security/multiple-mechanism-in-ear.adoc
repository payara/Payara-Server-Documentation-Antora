= Multiple HttpAuthenticationMechanism in EAR

_Since Payara Server 5.2020.3_

Within the Security API specification, an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` can be defined to retrieve the user credentials from the HTTP Request. These credentials are then used by the IdentityStore to validate the user. For an introduction, have a look at https://blog.payara.fish/ee-security-jaspic-jacc-loginmodules-realms[this article]

A restriction of the current Security API specification is that only 1 `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` can be defined within an application. This restriction also applies to an EAR file where you can have multiple Web application bundled.

There is already an issue to address this restriction at the Security API project, but as an intermediate solution, we have introduced a new `web.xml` parameter within Payara so that you can define an `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` for each Web applications in an EAR artifact.

[[configure]]
== Configure

In order to configure a specific `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` for a Web application, define the parameter `fish.payara.security.mechanism` within the _web.xml_ file.

[source, xml]
----
<context-param>
    <param-name>fish.payara.security.mechanism</param-name>
    <param-value>JWT</param-value>
</context-param>
----

The supported values are

|===
|Value |Description
|Basic |Use _BasicAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|Form |Use _FormAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|CustomForm | Use _CustomFormAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|JWT | Use the custom Payara _JWTAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|Certificate | Use the custom Payara _CertificateAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|Azure | Use the custom Payara _AzureOpenIdAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|Google | Use the custom Payara _GoogleOpenIdAuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|OAuth2 |Use the custom Payara _OAuth2AuthenticationMechanism_ as mechanism.
|<any Fully Qualified Class Name> |Use the `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` indicated by the classname.
|===

When no parameter is specified, the standard rules of the Security API are active (only 1 allowed per artifact).
