_Since 5.183_

*Usage*::
`asadmin >generate-bash-autocomplete output_file`

*Aim*::
Creates an asadmin autocompletion script for bash.

The created file will be on the server and not the client.

to copied from the server to the client.
Add the resulting file to your bash path by adding
`source path/to/outputfile` to your .bashrc

`asadmin` in a terminal and you can use double-tab to autocomplete a command,
similar to other bash commands.
