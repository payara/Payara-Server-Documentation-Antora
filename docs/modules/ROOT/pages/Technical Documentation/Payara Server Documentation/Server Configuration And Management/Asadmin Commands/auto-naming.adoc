= Auto-Naming

_@Since **Payara Server 5.193**_

The auto-naming feature is an _asadmin_ feature added to help with the naming of instances,
deployment groups, and other resources by resolving name conflicts and auto-generating names for dynamic resources.

[[usage]]
== Usage

The _autoname_ option is enabled either by specifying `--autoname` or `-a` on the command line before or after the
command name. This is technically an _asadmin_ option rather than a command parameter so
should be specified before the command name - it will however still accept being specified after the
command name (see examples).

NOTE: Although it should work in most cases, there are some circumstances in which specifying the `--autoname` or `-a` option _after_ the command name will result
in the option not taking effect, which is why we recommend that you place it before the command name.

When enabled, this feature allows commands that accept `String` names as their primary parameter (the parameter that you
don't have to specify, e.g. the `instancename` parameter for the `create-instance` command) to generate a name.
To automatically generate a name for your instances or resources, simply enable the _autoname_ option and omit
providing a name (example below).

Specifically for the `create-instance` and `create-local-instance` commands, the _autoname_ option can also be used to
automatically resolve any name conflicts. When resolving a name conflict, Payara Server Community will simply
append a new name to the existing name, like so: `instance1-BamboozledBarracuda`.

When creating an instance from the admin console, there is a new Auto Name checkbox present, which performs the same
conflict resolution function as the _autoname_ CLI option.

NOTE: This checkbox does not currently allow you to generate an instance name from
scratch - it simply resolves any name conflicts.

It should be stressed that these options are optional and disabled by default - if you wish to retain the original
behaviour of prompting for a name or refusing to create an instance due to a name conflict, no action is necessary.

[[Examples]]
=== Examples

Name generation:
[source, bash]
----
asadmin -a create-instance --node localhost-domain1    -> BemusedCatfish created
asadmin create-local-instance --node localhost-domain1 --autoname    -> ConfusedCarp created
asadmin create-instance --node localhost-domain1    -> Please enter an instance name: instance1    -> instance1 created
asadmin create-instance --node localhost-domain1    -> Please enter an instance name: instance1  -> command failed: instance name already in use
----

Name conflict resolution:
[source, bash]
----
asadmin --autoname create-instance --node localhost-domain1 instance1    -> instance1 created
asadmin create-instance --node localhost-domain1 --autoname instance1    -> instance1-BemusedCatfish created
asadmin create-instance --node localhost-domain1 instance1    -> command failed: instance name already in use

[[Extra-Terse]]
== The Extra Terse Option

The _extraterse_ option is intended for use with scripts, adding an extra level of terseness to the command output to
the CLI. Currently this feature only works with the `create-instance` and `create-local-instance` commands.

When enabled, the `create-instance` and `create-local-instance` commands should only return the name of the instance
created. The intention behind this feature being that you should be able to set variables from this output for use with
scripts, since you can't know beforehand what the name of an instance is if a name conflict is resolved or a name is
generated from scratch.

This option can be enabled either by specifying `--extraterse` or simply `-T` on the command line (in comparison, the
normal _terse_ option is enabled with `--terse` or `-t`) before or after the command name. Being a CLI option rather
than a command parameter, it is recommended that you specify it before the command name, as the ability to specify
asadmin options (like `--host`) after the command name is technically deprecated syntax and will be ignored in certain
circumstances.

NOTE: The _extraterse_ option implicitly enables the _terse_ option - this is true for *all* commands (not just
`create-instance` and `create-local-instance`).
