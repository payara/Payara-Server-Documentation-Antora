= Domain Data Grid Concept
This section covers the Domain Data Grid concept and usage in Payara Server.
The Domain Data Grid uses hazelcast as its clustering technology and enhances the original Hazelcast integration of Payara 4.

_Since Payara Server 5.181_

== Concept
The Domain Data Grid provides an in-memory data structure that is distributed amongst all the
Payara Server Community instances within a Payara Domain. The Data Grid is highly available
and highly scalable and enables in-memory data storage and sharing between all Payara Server instances
in a domain. The Domain Data Grid is used as the backing store for web session data,
Stateful Session Bean state, xref:/documentation/payara-server/jcache/jcache.adoc[JCache] caches, Clustered Singletons, and Single Sign On state as well as internal
Payara domain data like performance metrics and traces. In addition Persistent EJB Timers can
also be configured to be stored in the grid. The Domain Data Grid also enables light-weight
messaging between server instances and is the foundation of the CDI Clustered Event Bus.

The Domain Data Grid greatly simplifies traditional clustering as by default it is always on,
always available and usually requires no special configuration.

The Domain Data Grid has been designed to work out of the box in a variety of network
topologies and usually requires zero configuration in LAN, Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform and
Microsoft Azure.

=== High Availability

The Domain Data Grid achieves high availability for data storage by maintaining
a replica on another Payara Server Instance of any data placed into the Domain Data Grid.
This replica will be placed, as a preference, on an instance that is not running on the
same host as the primary data item. If the instance holding the primary copy of a piece
of data fails then the backup copy will become the primary and another instance will be selected
to hold a back up of the data.

=== Scalability

The Domain Data Grid provides high scalability for data placed into the Data Grid.
As a primary and a secondary copy of any data item placed into the grid the more instances
that are added to the Payara Domain the more JVM heap is available for storage of data in the grid.
The Domain Data Grid can scale to 10s and 100s of instances allowing large data sets to be stored
in memory. Read and Write performance for data in the grid is not dependent on the
number of Payara Server instances in the domain providing scalability to grids containing
large numbers of Payara Server instances.

=== Elasticity

The Domain Data Grid does require configuring with a specific number of Payara Server instances.
Payara Server Community and Payara Micro Community instances can be added and removed and the Data Grid
will shrink and grow as required. This meets the needs of cloud and container based architectures
which can scale up or scale down the number of Payara instances handling requests.

=== Payara Micro Interoperability

The Domain Data Grid is designed to be interoperable with Payara Micro and Payara Micro
instances can join the Data Grid and store data. Payara Micro has a specific cluster mode
which can be enabled to join a Domain Data Grid.

=== Data Grid Discovery

The Domain Data Grid has the concept of discovery. When a Payara Server Community or Payara Micro Community
instance starts it must discover other Data Grid nodes so that it can join the grid.
Once an instance has connected to a Payara Instance that is already a member of the grid then
it can become a member of the grid.

Payara provides a number of configurable xref:discovery.adoc[Discovery Modes]

=== Hazelcast

The Domain Data Grid is built on top of Hazelcast a popular and powerful open-source Data Grid
technology used in many mission critical systems.
