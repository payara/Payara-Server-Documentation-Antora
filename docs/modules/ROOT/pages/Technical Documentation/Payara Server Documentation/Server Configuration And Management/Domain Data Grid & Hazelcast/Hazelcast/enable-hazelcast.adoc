= Enabling and Disabling the Data Grid

In the default domain configuration of Payara the Domain Data Grid is enabled by default.

It can be enabled/disabled either through the Admin Console, or by using a command line
_asadmin_ command.

[[enabling-hazelcast-admin-console]]
== Disabling Data Grid for an instance through the Admin Console

From the Admin Console home:

. Select Data Grid under the instance's configuration from the page tree:

. Unheck "Enabled" (and optionally "Dynamic" to apply the configuration without a
restart) and save.

CAUTION: Disabling the Data Grid for a configuration will disable the Data Grid for
all instances using the configuration. If this is combined with Dynamic and multiple
instances restart their underlying Hazelcast instance immediately on clicking save data loss could occur in the grid.
If this is a problem ensure Dynamic is unchecked and restart each affected instance manually in turn.


[[enabling-hazelcast-asadmin]]
== Disabling DataGrid using Asadmin

The `set-hazelcast-configuration` asadmin command can be used to enable or disable
Hazelcast and therefore the Data Grid. This
command is also used to configure other aspects of Hazelcast, which is covered
xref:/documentation/payara-server/hazelcast/configuration.adoc#configuring-hazelcast-using-asadmin[in the configuration section].
The command requires the Admin Server to be running, and will expect it to be listening
on port **4848** unless specified differently with the asadmin utility `--port` option.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=false
----

If no target is specified, the command will disable Hazelcast on the
domain configuration _(server-config)_ which equates to the DAS. To disable Hazelcast on another
instance, configuration or cluster, use the `--target` option like so:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=false --target=${Target}
----

The `dynamic` option of the asadmin command defaults to true, so to
enable Hazelcast and require a restart of the target instance/cluster, use
`--dynamic=false`:

CAUTION: Using `--dynamic=true` will cause a restart of the underlying Hazelcast instance
in each affected instance. If multiple instances restart simultaneously this can result in
data loss in the Data Grid. If this is a problem use `--dynamic=false` and restart each
instance manually in turn.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-hazelcast-configuration --enabled=false --dynamic=false
----
