{ server-/127.0.0.1:5900-this }

asadmin> list-hazelcast-cluster-members
Instance Name  Instance Group  Instance Type  Host Name  HTTP Ports  HTTPS Ports  Admin Port  Hazelcast Port  Lite Member  Deployed Applications  Last Hearbeat
server         server-config   DAS            127.0.1.1  8080        8181         4848        5900            false        __admingui             2019-03-05 09:25:42

Since 5.191, a "Last Heartbeat" field will also be shown (pictured above), displaying the date and time that the DAS
last received a heartbeat pulse from a Payara Server or Payara Micro instance. This heartbeat should refresh every 5
seconds.
