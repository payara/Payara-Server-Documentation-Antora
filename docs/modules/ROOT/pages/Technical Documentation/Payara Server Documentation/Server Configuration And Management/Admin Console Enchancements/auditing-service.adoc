[[admin-console-auditing-service]]
= Admin Console Auditing Service

_Since Payara Server 5.192_

This feature allows users to log all actions and operations executed via the admin console for auditing purposes.

[[configuring-the-auditing-service]]
== Configuring the Auditing Service

All operations executed by users with access to the admin console will be translated to events that correspond to the specific admin user that executed the operation and the `asadmin` command (and its parameters) that is equivalent to the operation being executed in the admin console. For example if the default `admin` user modifies the monitoring level of the _Web Services Container_, the following event will be generated:

----
AUDIT - admin issued command set with parameters 
{
    DEFAULT: [configs.config.server-config.monitoring-service.module-monitoring-levels.web-services-container=HIGH]
}
----

The auditing service will relay these events to the xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification Service]. In this manner, administrators can be alerted of suspicious activity as soon as possible.

This service can be configured from the admin console and from the command line. 

[[from-the-admin-console]]
=== From the Admin Console

The auditing service configuration can be found in the web console under `Configurations` -> `<configuration-name>`` -> `Security` -> `Admin Audit`:

image:admin-console/admin-audit-menu.png[Admin Audit Service in Web Console]

Once enabled, actions in the admin console that have a corresponding `asadmin` command will be sent to the xref:documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notification-service.adoc[Notification service].

Check the *Enabled* option (and the *Dynamic* option too if you don't want to
restart the domain) to switch the auditing service on.

The *Audit Level* options sets the level of operations that will be logged:

**MODIFIERS**:: (Default setting) All operations that modify the configuration of the server in some capacity.
**ACCESSORS**:: All operations query the configuration of the server in some capacity.
**INTERNAL**:: All existing operations, including internal operations of the server.

Aside from this configuration setting, you can also define which notifiers will be used to relay the admin console audit events by moving them to the **Selected Notifiers** box.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that for audit events to be relayed to the
selected notifiers, both the Notification Service and each selected notifier must be enabled and configured beforehand.

TIP: You don't need to manually add each notifier on this screen. When enabling
a notifier on its configuration screen, the server will **automatically** add it to the list of selected notifiers for the Admin audit service. This same result occurs when enabling the notifier using the appropriate _asadmin_ command.
