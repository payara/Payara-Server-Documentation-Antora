[[h2-database]]
= H2 Database

H2 is a Java-based Database which replaced Derby as the default database in Payara 5. Derby as a database service that can be started and managed by Payara Server Community, has been removed starting from version 5.201

[[why-replace-derby]]
== Why replace Derby?
In terms of performance, Derby is one of the slowest embedded databases as  
compared to other H2, PostgresSQL, HSQLDB, etc. H2 also has a smaller disk footprint; the 
size of a JAR file is around 1.5 MB.

[[to-start-the-database]]
=== To Start the Database
To start the database run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> start-database
----

The above command will start H2 on the default port, which is 9092. 

[[to-stop-the-database]]
=== To Stop the Database
To stop the database run the command below:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> stop-database
----

The above command will stop H2. 

[[to-connect]]
=== To connect to H2 DB databases

To connect to an H2 DB database and execute SQL scripts, you should:

- Stop Payara Server if running
- Navigate to `/path/to/payara/payara5/h2db/bin` to find the h2db binaries
- Execute `java -jar h2.jar` (this will start the H2 Admin UI server and open browser with the Admin UI URL)
- In the browser, set JDBC URL to `jdbc:h2:/path/to/payara/payara5/glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/databases/ejbtimer` to connect to the EJB timer database (or change the path to connect to another DB)
- Leave the other options as they are and log into the SQL console
- Make sure to stop the `java -jar h2.jar` process before launching Payara Server
