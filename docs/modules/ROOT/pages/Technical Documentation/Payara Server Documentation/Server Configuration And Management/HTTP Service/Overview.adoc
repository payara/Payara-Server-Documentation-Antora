= HTTP Service

HTTP in Payara Server Community is composed of several configuration layers:

* A transport. The default transport is `tcp`.
* An HTTP protocol. One of the default protocols is `http-listener-1`
(which has the same name as the `http-listener-1` network listener).
* A network listener. One of the default listeners is `http-listener-1`.
* A virtual server. The default virtual server is `server`.

NOTE: Strictly speaking, the protocol also contains separate objects for HTTP and SSL options,
although most of the time this separation can be ignored.

The configuration for each of these objects can be found in their respective pages:

* Transport (Not yet documented).
