[[docker-instances]]
= Docker Instances

A Docker instance is the term used to refer to an instance created on a Docker node.
These instances exist within their own Docker containers, with the lifecycle of Docker containers
being tied to the instance it was created for.

Note about prerequisities of examples used in this part:

- `payaraDas` and `dockerHost1` are hostnames known to local naming service (or you can use IP addresses)
- DAS is listening on port 4848 on `payaraDas`
- Docker is listening on port 2376 on `dockerHost1`
- DAS can access `http://dockerHost1:2376`
- Docker containers can access `https://payaraDas:4848`
- user is on `payaraDas`
- there are no Docker containers yet, no Docker nodes and no instances registered in the DAS
- in `/app/passwordfile.txt` on `payaraDas` is at least one line with a correct password:
  `AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123`
- in /app/passwordfile-docker.txt on `dockerHost1` is the same line.

You should avoid to use the `payara/server-node:latest` tag, because it is changing without warning.
If you really have intention to use it, you can retag the image and use your own stable Docker image tag:

[source, shell]
----
>> docker tag payara/server-node:latest payara/server-node:mytag

[[managing-an-instance]]
== Managing an Instance

Docker instances are manageable in much the same way as any other instance.
Deployment of applications, assignation to Deployment Groups, editing of config,
should all be done just as if the instance was a standard SSH or CONFIG instance.

IMPORTANT: Please note that it is required that secure-admin be enabled for Docker instances to start
(which is why a passwordfile is mandatory when creating a Docker node).

[[creating-an-instance]]
=== Creating an Instance

There are two ways how to create a Payara Docker instance belonging to a Domain Administration Server (DAS).
You can create a Docker container node and instances on it using the DAS, but you can also create
a Docker container with a temporary node and instance directly from Docker.
These two use cases differ a bit in their lifecycles.

==== From Domain Administration Server

Creating a Docker instance is done in exactly the same way as when creating a normal one.
You will create a Docker node and then you can create one or more Payara Server instances on it.
The Payara DAS will use the same version of the Docker container as the DAS by default.

[source, shell]
----
>> asadmin --passwordfile /app/passwordfile.txt create-node-docker --nodehost dockerHost1 --dockerpasswordfile /app/passwordfile-docker.txt --dockerport 2376 DockerNode1
Command create-node-docker executed successfully.

Port Assignments for server instance DockerInstance1:

JAVA_DEBUGGER_PORT=29009

HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=28181
IIOP_LISTENER_PORT=23700

Successfully registered instance with DAS, now attempting to create Docker container...
Command create-instance executed successfully.
----

When you invoke these commands, a Docker container of the name DockerInstance1 will be created.
If a Docker container of the same name already exists, the create-instance command will fail,
and Payara Server will attempt to unregister the instance from the DAS.

WARNING: When autonaming is enabled, Payara Server will only attempt to resolve conflicts with
instance names - it will not attempt to resolve conflicts in container name.

WARNING: This type of instance is completely managed by the DAS - when you delete it, it will
be deleted also the Docker container including it's logs.

==== From Docker

Payara Server Community supports creating instances from Docker itself, making use of the
xref:documentation/payara-server/asadmin-commands/auto-naming.adoc[auto-naming] feature to resolve any conflicts.
The `docker container create` command creates a Payara Docker container without any contact with the DAS.
This is also the reason why Docker container has different name than the Payara instance - they
have different contexts and it is not possible to avoid naming conflicts, only to minimize them.

You can also specify an existing Docker node name in `PAYARA_NODE_NAME` property (and ideally
also `DOCKER_CONTAINER_IP`) and/or xref:documentation/payara-server/deployment-groups/Overview.adoc[Deployment Group] in `PAYARA_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP` property, then the Docker instance will be created as if it would be created
from the DAS, except the fact that the DAS will be informed about that later with the first
startup of the new Docker container.

If the property was not specified or the node does not exist, a temporary Docker node and instance
will be created on the DAS.
The temporary Docker node is bound to the instance, so when you delete the instance,
the temporary Docker node will be deleted too.
This type of node is also not listed in the DAS or offered in inputs and cannot be edited.

If the instance running on a temporary Docker node is stopped from the DAS, it is immediately
unregistered from the DAS.
The next start of the same Docker container creates new a Payara Server Instance and a new temporary
Docker node again despite the fact that it uses the same Docker container.

If the Docker containers are stopped externally to Payara (ie. by the `docker` command), the node
and instance will be marked for deletion and cleaned up on shutdown of the DAS.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget that you are configuring connection to DAS from the viewpoint
of the instance container, so configure also the Docker networking appropriately.

[[starting-an-instance]]
=== Starting and Stopping an Instance

Instances on temporary Docker nodes have their lifecycle bound to a started container.
So from the DAS point of view they are started or do not exist.

Starting a Docker instance on standard Docker node should be done just as if it were an instance on an SSH node.
When the `asadmin start-instance` command is invoked, the DAS will contact the Docker Rest API
as configured in the node config, and start the Docker container and the instance within it.

WARNING: If the command hangs, the Docker instance probably failed to start.
Use the `docker logs` command to see what happened.

[source, shell]
----
>> asadmin --passwordfile /app/passwordfile.txt start-instance DockerInstance1
Command start-instance executed successfully.

>> asadmin --passwordfile /app/passwordfile.txt stop-instance DockerInstance1
The instance, DockerInstance1, is stopped.
Command stop-instance executed successfully.
----

[[deleting-an-instance]]
=== Deleting an Instance

Much as with when creating a standard Docker instance, deleting a Docker instance is done
in the same way as other instances: with the `asadmin delete-instance` command.
This will unregister the instance from the DAS, and delete the Docker container.

Containers on temporary Docker nodes are not deleted by the DAS, they will be only stopped
and removed from the DAS management including the temporary Docker node.
The container management is controlled by the Docker.

[source, shell]
----
>> asadmin --passwordfile /app/passwordfile.txt delete-instance DockerInstance1
Successfully removed instance DockerInstance1 from the DAS configuration, and removed the container from node DockerNode1 (dockerHost1).
Command delete-instance executed successfully.
----

WARNING: if you would delete the container directly with the `docker` command, the DAS would not know it.
Such inconsistency can be resolved only by deletion of the instance from the DAS.
This is automatically done on DAS restart.

[[configuring-the-docker-container]]
== Configuring the Docker Container

Configuration of the Docker containers is done via system properties in an instances config
(and so can be shared across multiple instances).

A complete list of the available configuration options can be found in the Docker Engine REST API here:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/#operation/ContainerCreate

IMPORTANT: The image name is not configurable - Payara Server expects the image name to
match the value from the node config

The configuration within Payara Server Community of the settings denoted in the above link takes the form of dotted names. These
names adhere to the following syntax:

* Each property is prepended with "Docker"
* Each child object is specified individually, with all of its parents prepended to it
* Arrays must be surrounded with square braces
* Array values are separated using the vertical bar symbol "|"
* The colon character is used to denote the value of an object within an array
* Objects within an array are separated using a comma

Properties that are denoted by arrays of objects containing further objects or arrays are not currently supported.
The Env property is unique in that the colon character is used to denote the equals sign, as Payara Server does not
currently support properties that contain an equals in their value.

See below for some examples:

|===
|Example| Original JSON |Payara System Properties

|Arrays must be surrounded with square braces & array values separated using the vertical bar symbol "\|"
|{ENV: [arg1=foo,arg2=bar]}
|Docker.Env=[arg1:foo\|arg2:bar]

|Each child object of a parent object is specified individually
|{HostConfig: {Memory: 2048, CpuShares: 3}
|Docker.HostConfig.Memory=2048
 Docker.HostConfig.CpuShares=3

|The colon character is used to denote the value of an object within an array & objects within an array are
 separated using a comma
|{HostConfig: {BlkioDeviceReadBps: [{Path: /opt/foo, Rate: 24},{Path: /opt/bar, Rate: 48}]}
|Docker.HostConfig.BlkioDeviceReadBps=[Path:/opt/foo,Rate:24\|Path:/opt/bar,Rate:48]
|===

[[reserved-environment-properties]]
=== Reserved Environment Properties

The following Docker Environment properties are used by the default Docker image, _payara/server-node_, which you may
wish to override to match your configuration (particularly if creating containers directly from Docker):

|===
|Environment Property| Use| Default Value

| PAYARA_DAS_HOST
| The IP address or hostname of the Domain Administration Server that the instance will register itself to.
| localhost

| PAYARA_DAS_PORT
| The port that the Domain Administration Server is running on
| 4848

| PAYARA_NODE_NAME
| The name of the node that the instance should be created on.
| ""

| PAYARA_INSTANCE_NAME
| The name of the instance to be created.
| ""

| PAYARA_CONFIG_NAME
| The name of the config that the created instance should use.
| ""

| DOCKER_CONTAINER_IP
| The IP address or hostname that the Docker Container should use. This is used for verifying that a given node's
network config maps to this container, or for when creating new nodes and instances.
| First result of `hostname -I` (all IP addresses, excluding loopback)

| PAYARA_DEPLOYMENT_GROUP
| The name of the xref:documentation/payara-server/deployment-groups/Overview.adoc[Deployment Group] that the instance should join. Once the instance joins the Deployment Group, all the application targeted at the Deployment Group will automatically deploy to it.
| ""

|===

IMPORTANT: The DAS expects to be able to talk to each instance using the port listed in its config.
Don't forget to properly configure used networks.
