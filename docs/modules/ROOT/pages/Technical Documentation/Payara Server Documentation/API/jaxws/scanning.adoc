= Additional Scanning Locations

_Since Payara Server 5.191_

Payara Server scans for specific JAX-WS files in locations
further to those specified in the *JAX-WS* specification.
This page details the additional directories that will be scanned.

[[jax-ws-catalog]]
== `jax-ws-catalog.xml`

The JAX-WS 2.2 specification states that the `jax-ws-catalog.xml` file should be searched for in the `META-INF` directory of a deployed `WAR` file relative to the classpath. Since the classpath of a WAR can be found in `/WEB-INF/classes/`, this means that this file is expected at `/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml` (from the root of the `WAR`). Payara Server also searches for this file at `/WEB-INF/jax-ws-catalog.xml`.
