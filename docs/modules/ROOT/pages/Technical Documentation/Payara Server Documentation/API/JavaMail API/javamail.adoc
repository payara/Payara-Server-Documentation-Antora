[[javamail]]
= JavaMail

A JavaMail session resource represents a mail session within the
JavaMail API. JavaMail sessions configured here can be referred to by
their JNDI name.

[[from-the-admin-console]]
== Configurating a JavaMail session from the Admin Console

JavaMail sessions are added from the `Resources` tab on the left pane of
the Admin Console. Select `New` on the `Sessions` table to create a new
JavaMail session:

Emails will be sent with a return address of `example@example.com`,
using `SMTP` to send mail and `IMAP` to retrieve mail. With the current
implementation of the JavaMail API there is no alternative transport
protocol provided by default, though as an alternative to the default
store protocol of `imap`, `pop3` is available.

All protocols require that their associated protocol package be
included; more details on the
https://javamail.java.net/nonav/docs/api/overview-summary.html[
JavaMail API documentation].

Typically, when setting up `SMTP` access, three additional properties
must be specified in the Additional Properties table: enabling `startTLS`,
enabling authentication, and the password. These allow for extra
security when sending emails and will not always be required - check
with your email provider for their specific configuration.

The example below shows the configuration of a mail host:

[[from-asadmin]]
== Configurating a JavaMail session using an asadmin command

JavaMail sessions can be created directly using an asadmin command as well.
Additional Properties (as entered on the table on the Admin Console) are
added with the `--property` command-line argument as a series of colon
separated key/value pairs.

The sample command below demonstrates this, using the same configuration as
pictured on the previous section:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin create-javamail-resource --mailhost mail.example.com --mailuser example --fromaddress example@example.com --storeprotocol=imap --storeprotocolclass=com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore --transprotocol=smtp --transprotocolclass=com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport --password mypassword --auth true --property mail-smtp-starttls-enable=true --target=exampleNodeName mail/EmailNotifications
