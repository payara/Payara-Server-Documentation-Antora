= Accessing the Caching Provider and Cache Manager

To create a
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/Cache.html[Cache],
you will need to access
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/spi/CachingProvider.html[CachingProvider]
or
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/CacheManager.html[CacheManager].
Both are provided by Hazelcast embedded in Payara Server.

== Using Injection

You can use injection to access and use the
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/spi/CachingProvider.html[CachingProvider]
and
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/CacheManager.html[CacheManager]
embedded in Payara. Inject them into your application like so:

[source, java]
----
import javax.cache.CacheManager;
import javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider;
import javax.inject.Inject;
...
@Inject
CacheManager manager;
@Inject
CachingProvider provider;
----

NOTE: Your war or jar must be an implicit or explicit bean archive, i.e.
contains a CDI Bean with a bean defining annotation, an EJB Session Bean
or a beans.xml file.

[[using-jndi]]
== Using JNDI

Embedded Hazelcast in Payara Server has a
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/spi/CachingProvider.html[CachingProvider]
and
https://ignite.incubator.apache.org/jcache/1.0.0/javadoc/javax/cache/CacheManager.html[CacheManager]
registered to JNDI, so you do not have to create your own. To access
them, import the following classes and initialize two variables like so:

[source, java]
----
import javax.cache.spi.CachingProvider;
import javax.cache.CacheManager;
...
Context ctx = new InitialContext();
CachingProvider provider = (CachingProvider) ctx.lookup("payara/CachingProvider");
CacheManager manager = (CacheManager) ctx.lookup("payara/CacheManager");
----
