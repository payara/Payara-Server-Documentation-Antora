|Description
|Default
|Mandatory

|`--target`
|String
|The instance or cluster that will enable or disable its service
|server
|no

|`--dynamic`
|Boolean

|Integer
|Sets the maximum number of health checks to store
|20
|no

|`--historic-trace-store-timeout`
|String
|Sets the time period after which a historic health check event entry is removed from visable history. The time expression should consist of a number followed by a time unit; `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours or `d` for days. If no time unit is given the number specifies seconds. If the parameter is zero or unspecified there is no timeout for entries.
|-
|no

|`--set-notifiers`
|String
|Use the option to set the notifiers to the HealthCheck Service. It will replace all the notifiers that have already been set to the HealthCheck Service.  A comma-separated list can be used to represent multiple notifiers.
a|The notifiers avaiable by default are:
  
  * `log-notifier`
  * `jms-notifier`
  * `cdieventbus-notifier`
  * `eventbus-notifier`

|no

|`--enable-notifiers`
|String
|Use the option to enable a notifier. A comma-separated list can be used to represent multiple notifiers.
|-
|no

|`--disable-notifiers`
|String
|Use the option to disable a notifier. A comma-separated list can be used to represent multiple notifiers.
|-
|no

|===

NOTE: Enabling or disabling the health check service implicitly also enables or disables the log notifier which is the default notifier.

TIP: You can find the list of available notifiers using the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/asadmin-commands.adoc#list-notifiers[`list-notifiers`] command.
[[example-8]]
=== Example

The following example will enable the Healthcheck service such that it will
only activate from the next time the server is restarted. It sets the log
notifier and JMS notifiers and the historical trace store to retain 20 health checks.

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-configuration
    --enabled=true
    --dynamic=false
    --historic-trace-enabled=true
    --historic-trace-store-size=20
    --set-notifiers=log-notifier,jms-notifiers
----

service will not be enabled.

[[example-10]]
=== Examples
A very basic example command to simply enable the GC checker and activate it without
needing a restart would be as follows:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --enabled=true
 --service=gc
 --dynamic=true
----

[[example-11]]
Monitoring the health of JDBC connection pools is a common need. In that
scenario, it is very unlikely that on-the-fly configuration changes
would be made, so a very high `CRITICAL` threshold can be set. Likewise,
a nonzero `GOOD` threshold is needed because an empty or unused
connection pool may not be healthy either.

The following command would apply these settings to the connection pool
checker:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=cp
 --dynamic=true
 --threshold-critical=95
 --threshold-warning=70
 --threshold-good=30
----

[[example-12]]
Monitoring which threads hog the CPU is extremely important since this can lead
to performance degradation, deadlocks and extreme bottlenecks issues that web
applications can incur. In some cases the defaults are all that is needed, but imagine
that in a critical system you want to set the threshold percentage to **90%**,
and you want to make sure that the health check service guarantees the state of such
threads with a retry count of *5*. Additionally, you want to set the frequency of
this check for every _20 seconds_.

The following command would apply these settings to the connection pool checker:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=cp
 --dynamic=true
 --hogging-threads-threshold=90
 --hogging-threads-retry-count=5
 --time=20
 --time-unit=SECONDS
----

[[example-13]]
The following example configures the stuck threads checker to check every 30
seconds for any threads which have been stuck for more than 5 minutes and
applies the configuration change without needing a restart:

[source, Shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=stuck-thread
 --enabled=true
 --dynamic=true
 --time=30
 --time-unit=SECONDS
 --stuck-threads-threshold=5
 --stuck-threads-threshold-unit=MINUTES
----

[[example-15]]
The following example configures the Microprofile Metrics Checker to add 
`base_thread_max_count` metrics for monitoring, adds the checker to MicroProfile Health to 
display its result on MicroProfile Health xref:/documentation/microprofile/healthcheck.adoc#rest-endpoints[REST endpoints] 
and applies the configuration change without needing a restart:

[source, Shell]
----
asadmin> set-healthcheck-service-configuration
 --service=mp-metrics
 --enabled=true
 --dynamic=true
 --add-to-microprofile-health=true
 --add-metric='metricName=base_thread_max_count'
----

[[get-healthcheck-configuration]]
== `get-healthcheck-configuration`

*Usage*::
`asadmin> get-healthcheck-configuration`

*Aim*::
Lists the current configuration for the health check service, configured checkers
and enabled notifiers.

Monitored Metric Name  Description
base_thread_max_count Displays the peak live thread count since the Java virtual machine started or peak was reset. This includes daemon and non-daemon threads.
base_gc_total_total    Displays the total number of collections that have occurred. This attribute lists -1 if the collection count is undefined for this collector.
