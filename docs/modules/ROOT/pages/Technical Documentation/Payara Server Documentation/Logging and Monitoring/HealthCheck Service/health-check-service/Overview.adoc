= HealthCheck Service

_Since Payara Server 4.1.1.161_

Payara Server Community includes a HealthCheck Service that is disabled by default.
When enabled it can periodically check the following performance metrics:

* Host CPU Usage
* Host Memory Usage
* Payara Server’s JVM Garbage Collections
* Payara Server’s JVM Heap Usage
* CPU Usage of individual threads
* Detects stuck threads
* Monitors metrics exposed by MicroProfile Metrics

If there is a problem with any of these metrics and they exceed a
configurable threshold then a `GOOD`, `WARNING` or `CRITICAL` event
notification is sent to the Notification Service. Notifications can be then sent
to one or more notifiers, e.g. a log file.

This allows operations teams to rapidly detect problems or work out what happened after these
problems have occurred.

NOTE: Since Payara Server 5.2020.5 it is possible to display metrics produced by HealthCheck 
service on MicroProfile Health xref:/documentation/microprofile/healthcheck.adoc#rest-endpoints[REST endpoints]. 
You can find more information on 
xref:/documentation/payara-server/health-check-service/asadmin-commands.adoc#set-healthcheck-service-configuration[set-healthcheck-service-configuration].

NOTE: The Host Memory Usage currently only works on Linux and BSD derivatives.

If the
xref:/documentation/payara-server/notification-service/notifiers/log-notifier.adoc[Log Notifier]
is enabled, such events will be presented in the server's log file like in the
following sample:
