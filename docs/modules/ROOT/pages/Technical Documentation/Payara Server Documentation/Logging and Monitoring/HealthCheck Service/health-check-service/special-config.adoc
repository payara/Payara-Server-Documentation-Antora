= Special HealthCheck Service Checkers Configuration

The *Hogging Threads* and the *Stuck Threads* checkers are special on their configuration.
They do not have a threshold range configuration, instead opting for different attributes.

Here's a configuration sample of the *Hogging Threads* checker:

The following are the attributes used to configure this checker:

_Threshold Percentage_:: Defines the minimum percentage needed to decide if the
thread is hogged CPU-wise. The percentage is calculated with the ratio of elapsed
CPU time to checker execution interval. Its default value is **95**.
_Retry Count_:: Represents the count value that should be reached by the hogged
thread in order for the service to send notifications. Its default value is **3**

And here's a configuration sample for the *Stuck Threads* checker:

The following are the attributes used to configure this checker:

_Threshold Time_:: Defines the time value for which a thread can be non-responsive
before it is considered stuck. It's default value is **5**.
_Threshold Unit_:: Defines the time unit for the value of the **Threshold Time**
field. It's default value is **Minutes**.
