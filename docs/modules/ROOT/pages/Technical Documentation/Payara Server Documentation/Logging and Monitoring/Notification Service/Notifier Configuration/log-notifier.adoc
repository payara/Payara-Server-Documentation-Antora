= Log Notifier

The log notifier is the only notifier that is enabled by default when
the notification service is activated.

The default output for the log notifier is the configured instance log
file, which is either the _server.log_ file or _cluster.log_ file, depending
on the instance configuration.

From version 4.1.2.172, it is also possible to configure the log notifier to
output to a separate log file to avoid notification logs cluttering up the
server log, or to reduce the size of log files to parse by log file monitoring
software.

The log notifier only handles the output of notifications from the
notification service sent to the log and is not responsible for any
other log output - more details on Payara Server logging can be found on
xref:/documentation/payara-server/logging/logging.adoc[the logging page].

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

By default, the log notifier will receive notifications from the notification
service and output them to the configured logs when activated.

=== Payara Configuration

Because the log notifier is the default notifier for the notification service
it can be configured on the same page as the notification service, as shown in
the image below:

image:notification-service/log/log-notifier.png[4.1.2.172 log-notifier]

For any new domain, the notification service will be disabled by default. It
can be enabled through the admin console as shown above, or via asadmin commands.

To configure the log notifier through the asadmin tool, use the
`set-log-notifier-configuration` subcommand:

[source, shell]
