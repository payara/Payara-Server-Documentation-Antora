= Access Logging Max File Size

_Since version 5.183_

Both Payara Server and GlassFish Open Source Edition provides different ways 
to rotate access log files. On top of that, Payara Server allows access log file 
rotation based on file size. 

`Max File Size` option provides a way to change the file size at which the Payara 
Server rotates the access log file. This option accepts an integer value specifying 
the maximum size of the log file, after which a file rotation will occur. 
If the value for this option is set to 0 rotation is disabled.
